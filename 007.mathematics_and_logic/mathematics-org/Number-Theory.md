# Number-Theory
Number Theory: a branch of mathematics that studies the properties and relationships of numbers. Specifically it deals with the natural, or counting numbers

Numeral  System (or System of Numeration, or Number System): is a writing system for expressing numbers;that is, a mathematical notation for representing numbers of agiven set, using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner
  will have:
      represent a useful set of numbers (e.g. all integers, or rational numbers)
      give every number represented a unique representaiton (or at least a standard representation)
      relect the algebraic and arithmetic structure of the numbers

Positional Notation (or place-value notation, or positional numeral system): is a numeral system in which the contribution of a digit to the value of a number is the product of the value of the digit by a factor determined by the position of the digit.

Radix (or Base): is the number of unique digits, including the digit zero, used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system

Digits (Numerical Digit): is a single symbol (such as "2" or "5") used alone, or in combinations (such as "25"), to represent numbers
  written symbols

Number: is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label

Natural Number (or Counting Number) (ℕ): set of positive integers {1,2,3,..}; however other definitions included 0 (non-negative integers {0,1,2,3,...}
  used for counting and ordering

Whole Number set of non-negative integers {0,1,2,3,...}
  contains positive integers and zero
  set contains the natural numbers {1,2,3,..} and 0.
  the set is expressed as W = {0 ,1 ,2 , 3,...} starting from 0, each elemant x of the whole number set is generated by adding one to its predecessor, the number before x, which is w - 1. the use of the
  ellipsis (...) within the braces signifies that the number of elements in the set is not finite (that is, infitnite)

Integers is a number that can be written without a fractional component
  set of integers consists of zero (0), the positive natural numbers, and thier additive inverses (negative integers)
      Integers Z {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}
      Positive Integers Z-+ {1,2,3,4,...}
      Non-negative Integers Z-* {0,1,2,3,4,...}
      Non-positive Integers {0,-1,-2,-3,-4,...}
      Negative Integers Z-- {-1,-2,-3,-4,...}

Rational Numbers is a number that can be expressed as a ratio of an integer to a non-zero integer.
  such as 3/4 (the ration of 3 to 4) or -5:10 (the ration of -5 to 10)
  ratio of a to b is usually written as the fraction a/b.
  expressed as the quotient of fraction p/q of two integers, numerator p and a non-zero denominator q.

Irrational Numbers is a number that cannot be expressed as a fraction, cannot be written as the quotient of two whole numbers.
  as a decimal, an irrational number is shown by an infinitely long nonrepeating sequence of numbers
  such as π (pi, the ratio of circumference to diameter of a circle); e, base of the natural logarithms); and 2 (that number which multiplied by itself equals 2)
  there is an infinite number of irrational numbers
  are all the real numbers which are not rational numbers
  is a number that can be represented by a point on the number line but which is not rational.

Real Numbers is any number which can be represented by a point on the number line
  include the rational numbers, irrational numbers
  is a value of a continuous quantity that can represent a distance along a line
  include all rational numbers, such as the integer and the fraction, and all the irrational numbers

Imaginary Numbers is a complex number that can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit i, which is defined by property i^2 = −1
  the square of an imaginary number bi is -b^2
  zero is both real and imaginary
  for example 5i is an imaginary number, and its square is -25
  numbers that equal the product of a real number and the square root of -1

Complex Number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is a solution of the equation x^2 = -1
  a + bi, a is called real part, and is called the imaginary part
  allow solutions to certain equations that have no solutions in real numbers
  includes real numbers, imaginary numbers, and sums and differences of real and imaginary numbers.
  is the square root of a negative real number

Numeral (or Number Word): is a word or phrase that describes a numerical quantity
  can express relationships like quantity (cardinal numbers), sequence (ordinal numbers), frequency (once, twice), and part (fraction).

  Cardinal Numeral (or Cardinal Number Word): is a part of speech used to count (quantity)
  such as one, two, three and also compounds, e.g. three hundred forty-two

  Ordinal Numeral (or Ordinal Number Words): are word representing position or rank in a sequential order; the order may be of size, importance, chronology, and so on

Binary Numeral Base 2
Octal Base 8
Decimal Base 10
Duodecimal Base 12
HexadecimalBase 16

Transcendental Numbers
Algebraic Numbers

The natural numbers: N = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...}
The integers: Z = {...,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,...}
The rational numbers: Q = {−1,0,0.125,1,1.5,5/3,22/7,...}
The real numbers: R = {−1,0,1,e,π,−1.539...,4.94...,...}
The complex numbers: C = {−1,0,1,i, 1+i, 2+3i,...}
