digit sum
ds method of checking
rules to calculate digit sum
+ the sum of all digits in a number
  + 213 = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6
+ the digit sum should be a single digit number
  + 2134 = 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 10 = 1
+ ignore the number nine when adding across (casting out 9?)
  + 909 = 0
+ can also ignore number that add up to nine
  + 1802 = 2
    + 1802 = 1 + 8 + 0 + 2 = 1 + 1 = 2
  + because digit sum will remain the same when you add any number to nine
+ decimals work the same
  + decimals point doesn't affect the digit sum.

+ do the same operation; when ds checking
+ the digit sums of the answer and numbers in the problem; should be the same
+ checking additon
  + 85 + 45 = 130 = 4
  + 8 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 1 + 3 = 4
+ checking subtraction
  + 85 - 45 = 40 = 4
  + (8 + 5) - (4 + 5) = 1 + 3 = 4
  + when ds is negative; add nine to the negative number
    + 23 - 17 = 6
      + (2 + 3) - (1 + 7) = 5 - 8 = -3 + 9 = 6
    + 32 - 17 = 15 = 6
      + 5 - 8 = -3 + 9 = 6
+ checking multiplication
  + 93 * 11 = 1023 = 6
    + 3 * (1 + 1) = 6
+ checking division
  + 110 / 11 = 10 = 1
    + (1 + 1) / (1 + 1) = 2 / 2 = 1

multiplicand & multiplier
+ 43 + 23
+ 43 is the multiplicand.
  + is the number being multiplied.
+ 23 is the multiplier.
  + is the number which is multiplying the first number.

multiplication by 11
+ 423 * 11
+ the first number of multiplicand (number multiplied) is put down as the
  left-hand number of the answer.
  + = 4
+ each successive number of the multiplicand as added to its neighbor to the left
  + = 4 ( 4 + 2 ) ( 2 + 3 )
    + = 465
  + if the resulting addition has two digits; carry the one to the right
+ the last number of the multiplicand becomes the last number of the answer
  + = 4653

lr method
left to right method
rounding up
+ should only be done when you have to carry over a lot of numbers
+ last digit add up to 10
+ the remaining digits add up to 9
addition with rounding up
+ round up a number
  + 9981 + 1234
  + 10000 + 1234 = x + 19
+ add
  + 11234 = x + 19
+ subtract the amount you rounded up from the sum
  + x = 11234 - 19 = 11215
subtraction with rounding up
+ should only be done when you have to borrow a lot of numbers
+ round up the second number
  + 4530 - (3898 + 102)
+ subtract
  + 4530 - 4000 = 530
+ add the amount you rounded up from the subtracted amount
  + 530 + 102 = 632
one digit multiplier with rounding up
+ best with numbers end in 7, 8 or 9
+ round up the number
  (68 + 2) * 3 = -(2 * 3)
+ multiply from left to right
  210 = -6
+ multiply the amount you rounded up
  = 204
two digit multiplier
+ break the multiplier
  + 36 * (30 + 2)
+ multiply for left to right
  + 9180 + 72
+ add the individual answers together
  + 9252
two digit multiplier with rounding up
+ best with 7, 8, 9
+ round up a number
  87 * (99 + 1) = -(1 * 87)
+ multiply
  8700 = -87
+ subtract
  = 8613
multiplication after factoring
+ factor one of the numbers
  45 * 22 = 45 * 11 * 2
+ multiply the number with first factor
  = 495 * 2
+ multiply the product with second factor
  = 990

squaring
numbers ending with 5
+ multiply the first digit with the next higher digit
  + 65 ^ 2 = 42
+ attach 25 to the end
  + 65 ^ 2 = 4225
any number
+ round the number up or down to the nearest multiple of 10
  + 23^2 = 23 - 3 = 20
  + 48^2 = 48 + 2 = 50
+ if rounded down subtract; if rounded up add
  + (23 + 3) * (23 - 3)
  + (48 - 2) * (48 + 2)
+ multiply the number form the previous two
  + 26 * 20 = 520
  + 46 * 50 = 2300
+ square the amount you rounded up/down and add it to the number from the
  previous step
  + 520 + (3 * 3)= 529
  + 2300 + (2 * 2) = 2304

bridge method
+ 32 * 13 = 3
+ 323 * 13 = 3
+ 323 * 132 = 3

+ 32 * 13 = 3(3 * 3)+(2 * 1)
  + = 41
+ 323 * 13 = 3(3 * 3)+(2 *1)
  + 323 * 13 = 41(2 * 3)+(3 * 1)
  + =419
+ 323 * 132 = 3(3 * 3)+(2 * 1)
  + 323 * 132 = 41(3 * 2)+(2 * 3)+(3 * 1)
  + 323 * 132 = 425(2 * 2)+(3 * 3)
    + = 4263

+ 32 * 13 = 41(2*3)
  + = 416
+ 323 * 13 = 419(3 * 3)
  + = 4199
+ 323 * 132 = 4263(3 * 2)
  + = 42636
