## Problem-Solving Methods

Eight Disciplines Problem Solving
GROW model
How to Solve It
Lateral thinking
OODA loop (observe, orient, decide, and act)
PDCA (plan-do-check-act)
Root cause analysis
RPR problem diagnosis (rapid problem resolution)
TRIZ (theory of solving inventor's problems)
A3 problem solving
System dynamics
Hive mind
Experimental Action Plat the current window qn

1. definition of problems
2. Data collection, what is going on
3. Cause analysis, why, what is going on here
4. Solution planning n implementation
5. Evaluation of effect, did it work?
6. Standardization, make it simple from all experiment
7. Evaluation of process

dont get caught in a loop, every solution is a new problems
