Arithmetic: is a branch of mathematics that consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations on them-addition, subtraction, muliplication and division.
an elementary part of number theory 
is an elementary branch of mathematics that is used by almost everyone for tasks ranging from simple day-to-day counting to advanced science and business calculations.


Essence of Arithmetic

    extension to non-integer numbers of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system.

Arithmetic Operations and Related concepts
  Operation is a calculation from zero or more input values (called operands) to an output value.
    number of operands is the arity of the operation
    most commonly studied operations are binary operations, (that is, operations of arity 2) such as addition and mulitplication, and unary operations (operations of arity 1), such as additive inverse and multiplicative inverse.
    an operation of arity zero, or nullary operation, is a constant
    mixed product is an example of an operation of arity 3 called ternary operation
    generally the arity is supposed to be finite
    however infinitary operations are sometimes considered in which context the "usual" operations of finite arity are called finitary operations
      
    types of operations two common of operations: unary and binary
          unary operations involve only one value, such as negation and trigonometric functions
          binary operations on the other hand take two values, and include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
          operations can involve mathematical objects other than numbers.
          logical values true and false can be combined using logic operations, such as and, or, and not. 
          Vectors can be added and subtracted
          rotations can be combined using the function composition, performing the first rotation and then the second.
          operations on sets include the binary operations union and intersection and the unary operation of complementation
          operation of functions include composition and convolution.
          operations may not be defined for every possible value, for example, in the real number one cannot divide by zero or take square roots of negative numbers
        values for which an operation is defined form a set called its domain
          set which contains the values produced is called the codomain, but the set of acual values attained by the operation is its range. fof example, in the real numbers, the squaring operation onlq produces non.negative numbers; the codomain is the set of real numbers, but the range is the non-negative numbers.
        operations can involve dissimilar objects. 
        A vector can be multiplied by a scalar to form another vector.
        inner product operation on two vectors produces a calar. 
        an operation may or may not have certain properties, for exampe it may be associative, commutative, anticommutative, idempotent, and so on
        values combined are called operands, arguments, or inputs and the value produced is called the value, result, or output
          operations can have fewer of more than two inputs.
              
    An operation ω is a function of the form ω : V → Y, where V ⊂ X1 × ... × Xk. The sets Xk are called the domains of the operation, the set Y is called the codomain of the operation, and the fixed non-negative integer k (the number of arguments) is called the type or arity of the operation. Thus a unary operation has arity one, and a binary operation has arity two. An operation of arity zero, called a nullary operation, is simply an element of the codomain Y. An operation of arity k is called a k-ary operation. Thus a k-ary operation is a (k+1)-ary relation that is functional on its first k domains.
      
    The above describes what is usually called a finitary operation, referring to the finite number of arguments (the value k). There are obvious extensions where the arity is taken to be an infinite ordinal or cardinal, or even an arbitrary set indexing the arguments.
      
      Often, use of the term operation implies that the domain of the function is a power of the codomain (i.e. the Cartesian product of one or more copies of the codomain), although this is by no means universal, as in the example of multiplying a vector by a scalar.
  
  Order of Operations (Operator Precedence) is a collection of rules that reflect conventions about which procedures to perform first in order to evaluate a given mathematical expression.
