# Identity Operators `is, is not`

  Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually
the same object, with the same memory location.

Python Identity Operators

Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
Operator 	Description 	Example 	Try it
is  	Returns True if both variables are the same object 	x is y
is not 	Returns True if both variables are not the same object 	x is not y

For comparing memory locations of two objects, identity operators are used.

There are two types of identity operators. These are:
Python Identity OperatorsSymbol	Operator Name	Description
is	is	The result becomes true if values on either side of the operator point to the same object and False otherwise.
is not	is not	The result becomes False if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object
