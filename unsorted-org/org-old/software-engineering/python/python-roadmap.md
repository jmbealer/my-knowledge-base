# Python Roadmap

## Beginner

Data Types: List, String, Tuples, Sets, Floats, Ints, Booleans, Dictionaries
Control Flow/Looping: for loops, while loops, if/elif/else
Arithmetic and expressions
I/O (Input/Output): Sys module, Standard input/output, Reading/writing files
Functions
Exceptions and Error Handling
Basics of object oriented programming (OOP) (Simple classes)

## Intermediate

Recursion
Regular Expressions
More advanced OOP
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Encapsulation
* Method overloading
Data Structures
* Linked lists
* Stacks, Queues
* Binary Search Trees
* AVL Trees
* Graphs
* Minimum Spanning Trees
* Hash Maps
Algorithms
* Linear Search
* Binary Search
* Hashing
* Quicksort
* Insertion/Selection Sort
* Merge Sort
* Radix Sort
* Depth First Search
* Breadth First Search
* Prim's Algorithm
* Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Algorithmic Complexity
* Big O notation

## Advanced - A.I., Machine Learning, Data Science

Statistics
Probability
Brute Force search
Heuristic search: Manhattan Distance, Admissible and Informed Heuristics
Hill Climbing
Simulated Annealing
A* search
Adversarial Search: Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning
Greedy Algorithms
Dynamic Programming
Genetic Algorithms
Artificial Neural Networks
Backpropagation
Natural Language Processing
Convolutional Neural Networks
Recurrent Neural Networks
Generative Adversarial Networks

## Advanced - Full Stack Web Development

Computer networks (Don't need to go into heavy detail but an understanding is necessary)
Backend web dev tools (This is for app logic and interfacing with databases etc).
* Flask
* Django
Front end framework (This is for communicating with the backend)
* Angular 6+
* React/Redux (These are libraries not frameworks but most consider them a framework)
With frontend you'll also need
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript (also good to learn typescript which is used in angular. It makes writing Javascript nicer).
Relational database (Pick one and learn it, they're all quite similar)
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
Non-relational
* MongoDB
* Apache Cassandra (Wide-Column)
Caching Systems
* MemcacheD
* Redis
Cloud Computing (Knowledge of cloud computing is important nowadays)
* AWS (Offers the most services and has a 1 year free tier)
* Google Cloud
* Azure
Other 'Must Knows'
* Version Control
** Git (start using Github straight away, it's your portfolio!!!)
* SQL (Relational and Non-Relational Databases - Almost everywhere nowadays)
* Code Quality / Engineering Best Practices
* Basics of Cloud Computing - Pick a provider and start learning (AWS recommended - biggest selection of services)
* Scalable Systems Design - (https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
* Dynamic Programming and matrix manipulation
