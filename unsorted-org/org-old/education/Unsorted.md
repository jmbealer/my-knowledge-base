- Domains Benjamin Bloom has suggested three domains of learning
  - Cognitive: Deals with how we think
    - Categories are knowledge or recall, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.
    - To recall, calculate, discuss, analyze, problem solve, etc.
  - Psychomotor: Deals with the development of motor skills
    - Categories are perception, set, guided response, mechanism, complex overt response, adaptation, and origination.
    - To dance, swim, ski, dive, drive, ride a bike, etc.
  - Affective: Deals with emotions
    - Categories are receiving phenomenon, responding to that phenomenon, valuing, organization, and internalizing values

Types of Education
  - Andragogy
  - Heutagogy
  - Pedagogy: Theory and practice of education


Content and design architecture issues include pedagogy and learning object re-use. One approach looks at five aspects:

  - Fact – unique data (e.g. symbols for Excel formula, or the parts that make up a learning objective)
  - Concept – a category that includes multiple examples (e.g. Excel formulas, or the various types/theories of instructional design)
  - Process – a flow of events or activities (e.g. how a spreadsheet works, or the five phases in ADDIE)
  - Procedure – step-by-step task (e.g. entering a formula into a spreadsheet, or the steps that should be followed within a phase in ADDIE)
  - Strategic principle – task performed by adapting guidelines (e.g. doing a financial projection in a spreadsheet, or using a framework for designing learning environments)
