1001 Hardware

It is important to not only know the different types of computer hardware, but
to also understand how they work and actions you can take if they malfunction.
This study guide will review all of the hardware types covered on the CompTIA A+
Core Series 1001 test as well as information that will help you deal with
hardware issues. Be sure to access our practice questions and flashcards to give
you a feel for how to use this information.

1001 Hardware and Network Troubleshooting

It’s great to know the characteristics and functionality of equipment and
networks, but you also need to know what to do when they don’t work as they
should. You will be the “doctor” of sorts and there needs to be an effective
plan in place for dealing with problems. Use this study guide to help you
understand the necessary steps you can take to ensure good outcomes for all.

1001 Mobile Devices

Mobile devices are playing an increasing part in technology use today. Gone are
the times when you could assume that if someone was working on a computer, he or
she was using a desktop model. Now, more often than not, a much smaller, more
portable device is operational and the technology of these devices and their
functions are changing constantly. Use this study guide to learn what you need
to know to tackle mobile device questions on the CompTIA A+ Core Series Test
220-1001.

1001 Networking

Networks: how they are configured, how they work, major and minor parts, and
what to do if they don’t work for some reason. All this and more is covered in
the Networking questions on the CompTIA A+ Core Series test 1001. Browse through
the concepts in this study guide and find out what you need to study before test
day.

1001 Virtualization and Cloud Computing

This group of questions is completely new to the CompTIA A+ Core Exam. In the
previous test version, some of these concepts might have been touched on in
other areas of study, but this is the first edition of the test that devotes an
entire section of study to these topics. Use this study guide to guide your
review and seek out our practice questions and flashcards to see what you’ve

mastered.
1002 Operating Systems

One difference between the 2016 and 2019 CompTIA A+ tests is that the older test
separated Windows from other operating systems. In the newer test version, these
two systems are combined in the tested concepts outline. Whatever the system,
however, you’ll need to be familiar with it, and this study guide will tell you
just what you need to know about all of them.

1002 Operational Procedures

Anything tends to work better with a plan in place that covers all situations,
and technology-related operations are no exception. Use this study guide to find
out what all is involved in setting and following procedures, and learn what you
need to know for this type of question on the CompTIA A+ Core Series 1002 test.

1002 Security

There’s probably not a hotter topic today on the technology scene than this
one—security. It’s at the tip of every tongue and arouses more concern than just
about any other tech feature. Use this study guide to help you know how to
prepare for security-related questions on the CompTIA A+ Core Series 1002 test.

1002 Software Troubleshooting

Software is an extremely valuable technology resource, when it works correctly.
When it doesn’t, it will be up to you to determine the problem and devise a
solution. Use this study guide to help widen your knowledge in this area and go
over what you need to know for this area of questioning on the CompTIA A+ Core
Series 1002 test.
