Storage Devices (scenario)

You should be well-versed with the various types of storage devices and be
comfortable with the selection, installation, and configuration procedures for
each.


== Optical drives
Optical Drives

Optical drives use a laser to read and/or write data to an optical disk.


Optical Drives/Media Capacity

How to install an optical drive in a desktop PC 
• 
Choose an available drive bay (typically 3.5”) 
Open the side of the case
Insert the drive into the bay.  Secure with screws if necessary. 
• 
Connect SATA cable from system board to drive 
• 
Connect power cable from PSU to drive 
• 
Close the case 
• 
Power on the computer and install the driver (it may install automatically) 
 
An optical disc is read by a laser. 
Choose a drive that is compatible with the media you want to record on and/or
read.   
 
=== CD-ROM/CD-RW
CD-ROM/CD-RW—Compact disc-read only memory (CD-ROM) stores data, but you cannot
write to it. CD-RW is rewritable, so you can write data to it multiple times.
CDs store up to 700 MB of data.

CD-ROM / CD-RW

CD-ROMs are optical media drives that read round plastic discs which contain an
aluminum or dye coating on one side. This coating contains pits and lands or
binary ons and offs. CD-ROMs are mass produced by music or software distributors
and are read-only. The maximum capacity for a CD-ROM is 700 MB of data or 80
minutes of audio. Don’t forget to allow 2 seconds between each track if you are
cutting it close. 

CD-Rs and CD-RWs are writable CD-ROMs. CD-Rs can only be written once while
CD-RWs are rewritable, meaning the data on them can be completely overwritten
with new data or the disc can be erased. Writing to a writable CD media requires
a CD-RW drive. Since these drives use a red laser to write to the recordable dye
in the backing, CD-RW drives are referred to as a burner. CD-RW drives are most
commonly internal devices (PATA / SATA) but can also be quite useful as a
portable device, allowing you to back up data before working on a unit. You may
also see these drives’ write speed expressed as 52x or 48x where the x indicates
the increase in speed.

Pits and Lands in Optical media

Pits and Lands represent the ones and zeros in binary storage. The raised dots
or oblong bits displayed are the lands and the remaining space on the disc are
the pits. This technology is the same for all optical media. Only the density of
the lands varies, allowing for more data depending on the size and density.

=== DVD-ROM/DVD-RW/DVD-RW DL
DVD-ROM/DVD-RW/DVD-RW DL—Digital versatile disc-read only memory (DVD-ROM)
stores data, but you cannot write to it. DVD-RW is rewritable, so you can write
data to it multiple times. DVD-ROM and DVD-RW have a capacity of 4.7 GB. DVD-RW
DL is a dual-layer version of DVD-RW, nearly doubling the capacity to 8.5 GB.

DVD-ROM / DVD-RW / DVD-RW DL

The same principles that apply to CD-ROMs apply to DVD-ROMs, DVD-RWs, and DVD
DLs. The capacity of the DVD disc increased to 4.7 GB. This is accomplished by
increasing the density of the pits and lands while still using a red laser. It
was discovered that the capacity of the DVD-ROM could be doubled to 8.5 GB by
using two layers of recordable dye. The laser can then focus on one layer at a
time. All of the DVD drives discussed will be either internal (PATA / SATA) or
external.

=== Blu-ray

Blu-ray

Blu-ray (BD) technology is the highest capacity consumer grade optical
technology currently available. Blu-ray uses a blue laser that has a shorter
wavelength than the previous technologies, allowing for higher density data
storage. A Blu-ray disc has a capacity of 25 GB for a single layer disc and 50
GB for a dual layer disc. This dramatic capacity increase allowed movie studios
to distribute content that wouldn’t otherwise fit on a DVD. Enhancements such as
HD and 3D fit comfortably on a Blu-ray disc with room for alternate formats and
additional features.

Blu-Ray 
Capacity is 25GB per layer (with up to four 
layers, for a total of 100GB) 
 
=== BD-R
BD-R—Blu-ray disc-recordable (BD-R) is a Blu-ray disc that you can write to only
once. It has a capacity of 25 GB.

BD-R

BD-R is the 25 GB Blu-ray write once recordable disc. Blu-ray recordable discs
use the same speed rating identifiers that were used on CD and DVD technology.
For example, a 1x BD-R writes at roughly 36 Mbps and a 2x at 72 Mbps. 2x is
considered to be the minimum acceptable read speed for viewing BD-ROM movies.
Considering that it would take over 90 minutes for a 1x BD-R to write 25 GB of
data, the need for speed is important.

Also consider that your maximum write speed will be determined by the slowest
component: the drive or the media. You may have a 16x BD-R drive but if your
media is rated at 4x, it is unlikely that you will write at any speed near 16x.
Most Blu-ray devices will be backwards compatible to DVD and CD-ROMs. Considered
high end for PCs, the majority of these devices will be internal and use the
SATA 2.0 or higher connection in order to support the high transfer rates.
External BD-R drives are also available. These predominantly use USB 2.0 and
optimally USB 3.0.

=== BD-RE
BD-RE—Blu-ray disc - rewritable (BD-RE) is a Blu-ray disc that you can write to
multiple times. It has a capacity of 25 GB.

BD-RE

BD-RE discs are rewriteable but otherwise, use the same process as BD-R. This is
an advantage even though disc prices are coming down. The write speeds of BD-RE
drives are comparable to that of BD-R but there is some pre-write overhead that
takes time. The BD-RE media must be completely erased and verified before the
write process can begin.

== Solid-state drives
Solid-State Drives

Solid-state drives (SSD) use non-volatile RAM to store data. There is no disk
and no moving parts, so SSD tends to be more reliable than disk drives. Access
times are faster than disk drives.

• Solid-state drives

 M2 drives

Solid state drives are highly beneficial in standard form factors such as 2.5”.
These drives can be used to upgrade the performance of laptops with SATA
connections. As consumers wanted smaller and thinner portable devices, the M2
drive addressed the need by using the PCI Express Mini Card and SATA
compatibility. These drives offered the most storage and fastest speeds while
having a much smaller footprint in the device.

Hard Disk Drive 
How to install a hard disk drive in a PC

M.2 drives—M.2 is a form factor for SSD. It is 22 mm wide and can vary in
length. The most common lengths are 80 mm and 60 mm. It is referred to as
“gumstick memory” because its size is similar to a stick of gum. M.2 drives plug
into an M.2 slot on a motherboard.

Typically found in laptops 
Rectangular shape

=== NVME
NVME—Non-volatile memory express is a form of memory that uses the M.2 form
factor. It is the fastest SSD available today.

– NVME

Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) evolved from the M2 standard and offered even
greater speed. To get the most from an NVMe drive, use it as the boot device in
the system. NVMe drives use the PCI Express x4 to provide the fastest
performance.

== Magnetic hard drives
Magnetic Hard Drives

Magnetic hard drives use magnetic media on rotating platters to store data.
Speeds vary among different drives, but generally, the faster the rpm, the
faster response time in reading and retrieving data. Common speeds for hard
drives are: * 5,400 rpm
* 7,200 rpm
* 10,000 rpm
* 15,000 rpm


Magnetic hard disk drives

Magnetic hard disk drives are the primary storage device for most computers on
the market today. Solid state drives are coming down in price, but you will find
the cost per gigabyte is still the best for the magnetic hard disk. These drives
come in two main physical sizes: the 3.5” PC drive and the 2.5“ drive which is
better suited to portable devices. Surprisingly, the iPod Classic 160 GB media
player contains a magnetic hard disk.

When selecting a drive, consider the form factor and the rotational speed of the
disks. 2.5” disks are power efficient and compact, helping reduce the overall
size of portables while conserving battery life.

Magnetic Hard Drives – Speeds 
• 
For a drive to read data, it must rotate to the location of the data.  The
faster the drive, the 
faster it can read data.   
• 
Slower moving drives produce less noise 
• 
Drives will slow down when not in use in order to save power 
• 
Drives contain shock resistance to protect against damage 

=== 5,400 rpm
5400 rpm

The 2.5” disk is available with two platter rotation speeds. 5400 RPM drives use
less energy and are quieter, but do not offer the faster data rates that can be
achieved with a 7200 RPM drive.

Common speeds 
5,400rpm 
Laptop HDDs and some Desktop HDDs 
=== 7,200 rpm
7200 rpm / 10,000 rpm

The 7200 RPM drives on average consume more power.  The speed difference will be
tangible when moving large files or using disk intensive programs. 3.5” disks
are mainly used in desktop units. They are available with three rotational
speeds: 5400 RPM, 7200 RPM, and 10,000 RPM. 10,000 RPM drives are more expensive
and less power efficient. When it comes to pure performance in a magnetic
storage device using access speed as the main criteria, the 10, 000 RPM disk
will always win. These are used in servers and SAS (Serial Attached SCSI)
devices. In addition to needing a SCSI controller, the penalty for this kind of
performance is heat, noise, and poor comparative energy efficiency.

15,000 rpm hard disks found their niche in SAS applications. There is some
debate as to whether they are cost efficient in terms of capacity, noise, heat,
and power consumption when compared to SSD drives.


=== Sizes
Sizes—Magnetic hard drives come in different sizes, sometimes referred to as
form factor. A 2.5-inch form factor means that the disc inside the drive has a
diameter of 2.5 inches. The most common sizes are 2.5 and 3.5 inches.

== Hybrid drives
Hybrid Drives

Hybrid drives combine magnetic disk and SSD drives in one hard drive case. It
uses the disk for high capacity storage and the SSD for lower capacity fast
access, providing the best of both storage types.

Hybrid

Hybrid drives, or SSHD devices, strike the balance between cost, performance,
and capacity. By coupling a nominal amount of solid state non-volatile memory
with a terabyte or two of magnetic storage, the time it take to boot and access
frequently used program files can be decreased. When presented with the option,
your system’s firmware will store this data in the hybrid or cache portion of
storage, making it rapidly accessible when you reload the program or even reboot
since the data on the SSD persists without power and will be instantly
available.

Tips for selecting an HDD 
• 
Consider the application 
o Is the hard drive being used for gaming, video editing, or another
high-performance 
application?  You should consider an HDD with a high rotational speed or a
Solid-
State Drive. 
o Is the hard drive being used for an enterprise application?  Consider a SAS
drive. 
• 
Consider the budget 
o Magnetic drives cost approximately $100, while solid state drives cost between
$500 
and $1000.  Enterprise SAS drives can cost over $1000. 
• 
Consider the capacity 
o How much storage space do you require?  Buy a drive with adequate space. 
• 
Consider the computer 
o Does the computer BIOS support the type of drive that you want to install?
NVMe 
drive technology is not supported by older BIOSs.  
o Does the computer have space to install the drive?  If it’s a desktop, does it
have an 
available 3.5” or 2.5” drive bay?  If it’s a laptop it might only have space for
one or two 
drives. 
o Does the computer have the correct connector?  For example, does it have a
PCIe slot 


== Flash
Flash

Flash memory is a form of nonvolatile read/write memory. Nonvolatile memory
retains data when power is removed. Flash erases data in blocks, rather than at
the byte level. This makes it less expensive but slower than other forms of
nonvolatile memory.

• Flash – Be sure to write protect these devices when using them portably as the
risk of data loss or virus infection is very real. As the technology progressed,
so did the packaging and the capacity. Since they are small and don’t take too
much space, slots for these solid state memory packages were built directly into
laptops, offering safe and efficient portability of data. Yes, this was before
the Cloud. There really is no substitute for having a “hard copy” of your data
and these smaller, more efficient storage mediums continue to proliferate.

Memory

Compact Flash and SD

Laptop manufacturers support one or two package types, but not all. The most
convenient solution to this problem of design compatibility was to create a
portable USB memory card reader that would support all types of memory cards
such as the one shown below. If you look closely, you can see that the
multi-card reader will accept SD cards, Compact Flash, Micro-SD, and Mini-SD
storage cards. It’s nice to have one of these handy.

== Configurations
Configurations

Storage devices can be configured for high availability so that if one disk in
an array of disks fails, data is not lost. The most common configuration is
known as Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID).

RAID 
• 
RAID is a Redundant Array of Independent Disks 
• 
Requires two or more drives to make an array 
• 
RAID is fault-tolerant (in most cases) 
o The data is split over multiple disks in the array 
o If one disk in the array fails, then the data is not lost 
o Disks are typically hot swappable (we can remove a disk from the computer
while it is 
powered on and insert a new disk).  The computer will automatically rebuild data
on 
Requires a RAID controller to manage the drives 
• 
Drives without a controller are called JBOD = Just a Bunch of Disks (no RAID) 

=== RAID 0,1,5,10
RAID 0, 1, 5, 10—There are different RAID configurations that provide different
levels of data protection. Striping is a method of storing part of the data on
each drive in an array. Mirroring is keeping a full copy of a disk on another
disk.

    RAID 0: offers striping of data only; no redundancy; good performance
    RAID 1: offers mirroring of data only; requires more storage space to store
    full copies of data
    RAID 5: offers striping with parity; minimum of three drives; ability to
    calculate missing data and rebuild
    RAID 10: offers striping and mirroring for full redundancy; minimum of four
    drives

Raid types

This section covers all of the technology associated with RAID. RAID is
shorthand for a Redundant Array of Independent Disks. This technology allows
multiple disks to appear as a single volume. The disks are capable of creating
mirrored images of other drives and maintaining a consistent backup of a
particular disk. Some RAID configurations are very fault tolerant.

RAID assigns different numeric qualities to each level. There is Hardware based
RAID and Software based RAID. The most prevalent are RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, and
Raid 10. We will explain below what makes them different. There is another RAID
array, called JBOD or Just a Bunch of Disks, that only requires two or more
disks and the data is spanned across them. This array has no fault tolerance or
redundancy. The most prevalent RAID array configurations are explained below.

RAID 0

RAID 0 uses two or more drives and is used to increase the size of the volume
available. The data on the volume is treated sequentially and will be written
across all drives in the array. There is no parity. If a drive in the array
fails, the volume fails.

RAID 1

RAID 1 also requires two disks to be paired together. You would think that using
identical hardware, combining the drives would double the volume size. With
mirroring this is not the case. In RAID 1, the second drive is used as a mirror.
When you write data to the mirrored set, you write to both of the drives at the
same time and read requests can be handled by either drive.

RAID 5

RAID 5 arrays are quite special, especially in the way they store and manage
data. The minimum requirement is three physical disks. In this configuration,
there is a performance and fault tolerance and an increase in speed through the
use of parity. When data is written, it is spread across the available drives
except the parity drive. Each disk will contain both parity and standard data.
If a drive fails, there is enough information to completely rebuild the drives
in minutes, not hours that a backup based restore would take.

Raid 10

RAID 10 is the most recent RAID development and is also known as RAID 1+0. RAID
10 combines RAID 1 and RAID 0. The disk requirement is a minimum of four disks
where two drives are mirrored and two drives are striped, making this the most
robust storage solution available.

Data is split across two or more disks 
Each disk contains half of the data 
If one disk fails, all the data is lost 
RAID 0 is faster than a single disk because we 
can access data from two disks at the same time 
 
 
RAID 1 
Data is replicated across two disks 
Each disk contains all the data 
If one disk fails, no data is lost 
When reading data, RAID 1 is faster than a 
single disk because we can access data from 
When writing data, RAID 1 is the same speed as 
a single disk. 
 
 
 
RAID 5 
RAID 5 is faster and has redundancy 
Parity is distributed across multiple drives 
It requires at least three disks 
• 
We split the data across three (or more 
disks) 
• 
In this example, we split the data “A” 
across Disk 0, 1, and 2. 
• 
We calculate the parity bit Ap (the sum 
of the data bits A1, A2, and A3 
• 
If a disk fails, we can rebuild the disk by 
recalculating the data from the parity bit 
(or by recalculating the parity bit) 
• 
Notice that parity is distributed across 
multiple drives 
• 
If we were to store all the parity bits on 
a single drive, that drive would become 
overloaded.  That is why we distribute 

RAID 10 is a nested RAID level 
It combines RAID 0 and RAID 1 
We split the data across two drives, and then we 
make a copy of each of those drives 
 
This gives us faster speed (because we can read 
data from four drives at the same time) and 
redundancy (because we have two copies of the 
data) 
 
RAID 10 is the best choice for storing data where 
we have lots of read and write activities.  We 
can write twice as fast because we only write 
half the data to each set of drives.  We can read 
four times as fast because we can read from 

RAID 01 is a nested RAID level 
It combines RAID 0 and RAID 1 
We copy the data across two or more drives, 
and then we split each drive onto two drives 
This gives us faster speed (because we can read 
data from four drives at the same time) and 
redundancy (because we have two copies of the 

Other types of RAID include 
RAID 2 
RAID 3 
RAID 4 
RAID 6 
RAID 50 
RAID 60 
RAID 100 
But these are less common 
=== Hot swappable
HOT swappable—Hot swappable drives can be inserted or removed in real time while
the system is powered on. A common type of drive of this type is a USB flash
drive. Disks in a RAID array are often hot swappable.

Hot swappable drives

Hot swappable drives provide storage flexibility for PCs and laptops through an
external interface that allows hard disks to be added or removed without the
need to power down the machine. Originally this was a complex operation, but the
introduction of USB and SATA technologies combine to make this a reasonably safe
process. The configuration can be a single drive or an enclosure that houses
multiple drives which can be swapped in and out as necessary. It is a good idea
to check the write caching status on your drive dock that you intend to swap
your drives on. This is disabled by default but it’s best to turn this on to
allow recovery of lost data. You will find this setting in the Device Manager in
the properties of the device.
