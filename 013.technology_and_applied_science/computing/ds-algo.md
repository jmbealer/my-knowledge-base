**Algorithms**
  * Textbooks
      * [Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) (Sedgewick and Wayne)
      * [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms) (Cormen et al.)
  * Courses
      * [Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/browse/computer-science/algorithms) (Coursera)
      * [Introdcution to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/) (MIT)
      * [Bioinformatics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics) (Coursera) - while the subject matter might not be relevant to everyone, I think most computer scientists would benefit from taking this course as it really gets you thinking about efficient algorithms in a real world context.
