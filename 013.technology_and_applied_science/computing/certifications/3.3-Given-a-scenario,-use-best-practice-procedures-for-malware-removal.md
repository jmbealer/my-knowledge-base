Malware Removal (scenario)

Malware can spread rapidly and cause severe damage. Discovering malware is just the first step. It’s vital that you are able to remove the malware quickly without causing further damage. Be sure to follow these steps in order.
1. Identify and research malware symptoms.

Malware is not often as obvious as strange error messages and odd security warnings. It may be as subtle as a slight slowdown of the system or unexplained files appearing. There are plenty of sites that are dedicated to describing malware symptoms so thorough research should be done.
2. Quarantine the infected systems.

Any system suspected of being infected by malware should immediately be quarantined. This is so that the malware doesn’t spread across the network to other devices. The easiest way to quarantine a device is to simply pull out the network cord or disconnect it from Wi-Fi. Maintain all the files on the machine and don’t attempt to move them to another system.
3. Disable System Restore (in Windows).

The next step after quarantine would be to disable system restore in Windows. You do not want the virus to infect your restore points.
4. Remediate the infected systems.

When you have identified that type of malware and ensured that it can’t spread to other devices, remediation can begin.

a. Update the anti-malware software.— The first step would be to ensure you have an updated anti-virus application with a new engine and signature files.

b. Scan and use removal techniques (Safe Mode, pre-installation environment).— Restart the system in Safe Mode, pre-installation environment, and run a virus scan. While some viruses are more complicated and may require further remediation techniques, this will be able to remove most basic malware infections.
5. Schedule scans and run updates.

When a virus is removed, set the anti-virus to automatically update the signature files and schedule scans to run in order to prevent future infections.
6. Enable System Restore and create a restore point (in Windows).

The next step is to re-enable system restore and create Windows restore points.
7. Educate the end user.

Users are the last line of defense when it comes to computer security. This is because there is no antivirus or spam filter program that is 100% accurate. Even with these items in place, the user should be educated on proper email and Internet usage to avoid getting a malware infection on his or her device.



Identify and research malware symptoms

Every different type of malware has exhibits different behavior. Observe and record anything odd. Is it pop-ups? Inaccessible websites for updates? Everything you can observe will help you research the type of malware you are trying to remove.
Quarantine the infected system

Once you suspect an infection unplug the NIC and/or disable wireless connectivity. Remember this malware got into your system somehow and it’s fair that it hasn’t stopped trying to infect others locally or globally. Cut the cord (not literally)
Disable system restore (in Windows)

While system restore points and snapshots are useful tools, once you have an infection it is reasonably certain that the malware has tucked itself away in the restore files waiting to come back rested and fresh after you have spent hours removing it. Disable system restore (System Protection) which will remove all restore points.
Remediate the infected systems

Now it’s time to deal with your bug. First, we know you don’t trust the system, so create bootable Rescue media with updated definitions from another clean machine for use on the infected system.

Update antimalware software

If possible try to update your existing AV software after remediation. Success here will provide hope that you’ve resolved the issue.
Scan and use removal techniques (safe mode, pre-installation environment)

Now while booting directly to the system try scanning in safe mode, the pre-installation environment then hopefully you’ll come out clean.
Schedule scans and run updates

Once you are satisfied the condition is resolved, complete any and all OS updates and those of other programs especially malware. Set these programs to update automatically.
Enable system restore and create a restore point (in Windows)

Once all of your updating is complete re-enable System Protection and create a restore point. Label it to allow you to be sure this is the clean baseline.
Educate end user

Now, all along we touched on do’s and don’ts when it comes to running your system safely. So DON’T Click it! Seriously when you have to fight an infection of any sort you will immediately become proactive regarding defense. User education is the tip of the spear in malware defense. Take the time to inform the user tell them what happened, why, what the consequences are and then let them see the aggravation, I mean the steps necessary to eradicate the threat. Engage them in the solution – help them grow.
