= 3.1 Explain basic cable types, features, and their purposes.



Cables

You must be able to describe different cable types and their characteristics and
uses.

Sub objective 3.1 rehashes some of the concepts covered in 2.1, instead focusing
here more on the cable types themselves such as their construction, bandwidth,
and transmission limitations. Also discussed in this section are impediments to
overall signal quality and safety concerns.

Beginning with fiber optics, there is a good deal of material you will be
exposed to. An earlier section covered some of the connection types so apologies
for any repetition. In this objective, the content will be more specification
  oriented and will cover questions such as “what is the maximum cable length?”
  and “what speeds does cable X support?” Err on the side of preparation. One
  question could be the difference between success and failure. Having said
  that…here we go!

 
== Network cables
Network Cables

Network cables connect devices to the network. The most common types are
Ethernet, fiber, and coaxial cable.

Twisted Pair

Here, we look at the foundation and in many cases, the best solution, for your
connections. Most of this is worth knowing for your general working knowledge
base as well as for the test.

All of the following cable tables consist of some form of twisted pair cable.
Cables can be broken into two classes: shielded twisted pair (STP) and
unshielded twisted pair (UTP).

UTP vs STP

The difference between the two cable types is in the internal construction of
the cable, specifically the amount of insulation or shielding surrounding each
internal cable pair. Each internal pair is twisted using a specified number of
twists per inch. This reduces the possibility of the pairs being parallel to
each other and prevents crosstalk.
Types

CAT3 – Used in the early days, twisted pair implementations of this type use up
to six wires or conductors. The most common use of CAT3 is the telephone which
uses two pairs for each phone connection. This means the cable itself can
support two phone lines.


=== Ethernet
Ethernet

Ethernet cables use twisted pairs of copper wire. It may be shielded or
unshielded. Each category of cable has specific physical characteristics and a
maximum data rate. Ethernet cables have a maximum length of 100 meters.

Old cabling system, considered obsolete
Supports network speeds of 10 Mbit/s
Supports analog phone systems and digital
phone systems (Nortel, Panasonic, Avaya)
 
 
==== Cat 5
Cat 5—Category 5 cable supports data rates up to 100 Mbps.

CAT5 – Getting harder to find and no longer installed, this cable rating uses
four pairs and can support up to 100Mbps transmission speeds with a maximum
cable length of 100 meters (328 feet). You can get higher speeds in real world
applications but for the purpose of A+, remember the specification described
here.

Cat5
Old system for ethernet
Supports speeds of up to 1000 Mbit/s
Maximum length of a single cable is 100m
 

==== Cat 5e
Cat 5e—Category 5e cable supports data rates up to 1 Gbps.


CAT5e – This cable is known as CAT5 Enhanced where the enhancement refers to
reduced crosstalk. This doesn’t sound like a big deal until you look at the
speed improvement. How does 10 times faster sound? CAT5e supports gigabit
ethernet (1000Mbps)! This can be attributed to a stricter attention to the
number of twists per inch in the pairs. Remember, your hardware has to support
the speed. It’s not a magic cable. CAT5e supports 1Gbps with a maximum cable
length of 90 meters (295 feet).

Cat5e
Current ethernet standard
Supports speeds of up to 1000 Mbit/s
Maximum length of a single cable is 100m
 

==== Cat 6
Cat 6—Category 6 cable supports data rates up to 10 Gbps up to 55 meters and 1
Gbps up to 100 meters.

CAT6 – OK now we’re cooking! CAT6 supports 10Gbps at a frequency of 250 Mhz.
These speeds can be attributed to a further reduction in crosstalk. While
maintaining the same external RJ-45 form, the connector and cable are engineered
to further isolate the cables from each other, resulting in the higher
throughput.

CAT6

The wires are arranged in the connector to allow a slight, yet significant
separation compared with CAT5 wires, which run straight, horizontal, and
adjacent to each other. As you know, parallel cables will practically guarantee
crosstalk. The maximum length for a CAT6 is 90 meters with an additional 10
meters for a patch cable.

Cat6
Current ethernet standard
Supports speeds of up to 1000 Mbit/s
Maximum length of a single cable is 100m
Cat6 cable is more expensive than cat5e, but

New ethernet standard
Supports speeds of up to 10 Gbit/s
More difficult to install than cat6 because bends
and kinks to the cable can reduce its capacity
 
Cat7
Ethernet standard that was developed and


CAT6e – This enhancement doubles the transmission frequency to 500 MHz and
restores the traditional segment length to 100 meters (328 feet). This is
technically not a standard but CAT6e is widely recognized and observed.

CAT7 – This performance standard increases the transmission frequency to 600 MHz
and provides a more reliable and durable cable than its predecessors. CAT7 wraps
the entire insulated pair with an additional layer, wrapping the whole cable
bundle to provide an additional layer of shielding.

==== Plenum
Plenum—Plenum cable is used in the plenum space of a building. Any space that
handles air circulation in an HVAC system is plenum space, typically above a
drop ceiling or below a raised floor. Plenum cable uses low-smoke and low-flame
materials for fire prevention.

Plenum vs Non-plenum
•
A plenum space is a part of a building that is used for air circulation
•
Can include the space above a dropped ceiling or inside an air return
•
Cable installed in a plenum space must be rated as “plenum”
•
Plenum-rated cable does not create harmful gases when it burns
•
Non-plenum cable can create a fire hazard and may be prohibited by local
building codes
 
==== Shielded twisted pair
Shielded twisted pair—STP Ethernet cable uses two or four pairs of copper wire.
It uses a foil or braided shield to reduce electromagnetic interference.
Depending on the type of cable, each twisted pair may be shielded or a single
shield covers all twisted pairs.

Shielded vs Unshielded
•
The cable can contain a shield made of metal foil
•
The shield protects the cable from electromagnetic interference
•
The entire cable can be shielded, and/or each individual pair can be shielded
•
Cable is marked as UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) or STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)
==== Unshielded twisted pair
Unshielded twisted pair—UTP Ethernet cable uses two or four pairs of copper
wire. The twist in the wires reduces electromagnetic interference.


==== 568A/B
568A/B—Ethernet cables are terminated with RJ-45 connectors. The pin-out (which
wire connects to which pin) of those connectors is defined in the EIA/TIA 568A &
568B Standards. The difference between 568A and 568B is that the transmit and
receive pairs are reversed. This allows for two types of cables,
straight-through and crossover.

Straight-through is used to connect a device to the network via a switch or hub.
It uses the same pin-out on both ends, whether 568A or 568B. A crossover cable
is used to connect one device directly to another, such as two computers,
without a switch or hub between them. Crossover cables use 568A on one end and
568B on the other.

/568B
•
There are two methods for terminating a cat5e/cat6/cat6A cable
•
The methods are known as 568A and 568B
•
The ethernet cables contain 4 pairs of wires (colored as blue, orange, green,
brown)
•
The difference between 568A and 568B is that the position of the orange and
green wires is
swapped
•
Both 568A and 568B are acceptable termination methods
•
A cable should be terminated with the same method on both sides
•
A customer may require the cable to be terminated using a specific method.  Most
organizations prefer 568B.
Tips for installing ethernet cable
•
BICSI code provides specific rules for installing cable
•
Cable should be supported so that it doesn’t sag
o Can install cable inside conduits or use J-hooks
•
Cable is sold in 1000’ boxes
•
Can buy pre-made patch cables for short distances
o Home-made patch cables are not professional and making them is time consuming
•
Cable has different ratings
o Plenum vs non-plenum
o Outdoor rated cable, which is gel filled  

Resistant to cold temperatures and UV light
o Arial cable can be installed between poles (contains a solid core to prevent
the cable
from sagging)

=== Fiber

Fiber

Fiber optic cable uses light pulses to transmit data through a glass or plastic
core. The cable consists of four layers. The core is surrounded by a cladding
that refracts light back into the core. The other two layers are the outer
sheath, the part you see, and a strength member or buffer to protect the fiber.

Fiber is not subject to electromagnetic interference, since it uses light to
transmit data. Transmission distances are longer and data rates are higher on
fiber than they are on copper cable. There are two basic types of fiber,
single-mode and multimode. Single-mode fiber carries only one light path,
typically sourced by a laser. Multimode carries multiple light paths and is
sourced by an LED. Single-mode has a much longer transmission distance than
multimode.

Fiber Optic

Fiber optic transmissions use pulses of lights for signaling which are then sent
over plastic or glass strands. The glass medium (fiber) is susceptible to
breakage and signal loss if it is bent over a certain radius which is dependent
on the thickness of the fiber. Fiber optic cable should never be coiled
tightly.

Fiber detail

The fiber core is protected using a plastic sheath wrapped in synthetic strength
fibers, which give the cable resistance to breakage. A plastic outer sheath
completes the wire. If there is any concern about moisture seeping into the
cable, a synthetic gel is used to fill any gaps and protect the fiber.
Connector Types

We will discuss the connector types covered in your objectives. The benefits of
using Fiber optic cable versus copper are plentiful. Each connector can be
configured to use single-mode or multimode. A few major benefits are shown
below:

    Fiber has a broader bandwidth and is capable of handling more discrete channels at a higher speed. Fiber is immune to electromagnetic interference which cause signal degradation.
    Fiber suffers less signal loss (attenuation) over distance.
    Fiber cannot be “tapped” providing increased security over copper.

ST- The ST (Straight Tip) connector is one of the longstanding connector types.
You will see this in the field and you should be able to recognize it on sight.

ST Fiber Connector

Helpful identification points to remember are the BNC type connector and the
straight tip on the fiber.

SC- The SC (Subscriber Connector) has also been in use for some time and is a
very reliable and stable snap-in connector that offers low signal loss along
with ease of use. You may sometimes see this connector referred to as a standard
connector or a square connector because of its shape.

SC Fiber Connector

LC- The LC connector is a newer design relative to the others. You may see it
referred to as a Local Connector, Lucent Connector, or even a Little Connector.
The main advantage of this connector is its size. The LC connector is about half
the size of the SC connector but otherwise completely comparable.

Twisted Pair Connectors and Ethernet Wiring

Now we’ll look at the copper network cable types. Once the most exhaustive
connection method you would need to know for A+, the 802.3 series of cables are
now being replaced by Fiber and Wireless. Nevertheless, 802.3 cables are still
heavily used in the field with many networks running RJ-45 and wireless networks
covering the same areas. We will now look at the two main twisted pair
implementations: RJ-11 and RJ-45. Here is how the connectors compare.

T – 568 A & B detail for CompTIA A+ 220-1001

Changes in network hardware have made it possible for this connector to reach
speeds of 100Mbps. As the technology has advanced, even greater speeds can be
attained by making enhancements to the internal configuration of the connector
and the cable while leaving the original shape and size of the connector
unchanged.
Coaxial

Another network cable option is Thinnet or the RG-58 variant.

RG-58 Coaxial

This 10BASE2 connector and cable were harder to manage than its 10BASET cousin.
It used BNC connectors and a somewhat less manageable shielded copper core
cable. RG-58 matched the 10Mbps speed and had a longer range, but it was
difficult to implement the required bus topology and required a T connection at
each host, along with termination at the cable ends, to prevent signal
reflection.
F- Connector

Your objectives call for knowledge of the F-Type connector. This connector is
not as much a network connector as it is a video connector. Your Home Media
Center PC will require this connector in order to connect your cable or antenna
system to it.

F-Type Connector

An RG-6 cable uses an F-type connector. It is similar to BNC, however the F-type
connector screws onto the component, creating a connection where a failure point
will most likely be the cable itself rather than at the connection point. The
connection is strong and extremely unlikely to pull out.


Single Mode
Can be installed at distances of up to 200 km
Supports speeds of between 100 Mbit/s and 100
Gbit/s depending on the length of the fiber
 
Multi Mode
Can be installed at distances of up to 2 km
Supports speeds of between 100 Mbit/s and 100
Gbit/s depending on the length of the fiber
 
•
Fiber is rated as single-mode or multi-mode
o Within those ratings are sub ratings such as OM1, OM2, OM3, etc.
o The best multi-mode rating is OM4
•
A fiber optic cable consists of several layers
o The outer layers provide protection
o Fiber is not shielded for electromagnetic interference
o The inner layer contains multiple fiber strands
o A single cable contains between two and 60 strands
o Two strands are required to make a circuit (one strand to send and one to
receive)
o A typical cable installed in a building contains 6 or 12 strands

It is possible to install adapters for any of these types of connectors.

=== Coaxial
Coaxial

Coaxial cable is used primarily for cable Internet service and audio/video
applications such as cable TV. It has a single copper conductor core surrounded
by a dielectric insulator and one or more layers of shielding. The shielding
reduces electromagnetic interference. The two most common types of coaxial cable
are RG-6 for data and RG-59 for audio/video.

Speed and Transmission Limitations

Each type of network has speed and distance limitations.

    Category 5 cable supports data rates up to 100 Mbps.
    Category 5e cable supports data rates up to 1 Gbps.
    Category 6 cable supports data rates up to 10 Gbps up to 55 meters and 1
    Gbps up to 100 meters.
    The most commonly used fiber is multimode and supports data rates up to 100
    Mbps up to 2000 meters, 1 Gbps up to 550 meters, and 10 Gbps up to 300
    meters.

Coaxial

RG-6 (Radio Grade-6) cables have a variety of uses although they are used mainly
in communication. Construction can vary somewhat by the manufacturer, but all
RG-6 cables consist of a solid copper core encased in a plastic insulating
sleeve, which is then covered by a wire mesh (sometimes foil) that insulates the
cable from noise and provides grounding. All of this is contained inside a
plastic jacket. On RG-6 and RG-59 cables, an F-type connector is used to
terminate the connection. RG-6 is becoming the preferred cable type for cable
television (CATV) installations.

RG 6 cable

RG-59 (Radio Grade-59) coaxial cables were once heavily used in CATV
installations. The construction is identical to the RG-6 except the RG-59 uses a
thinner core. The RG numbering system uses increasing numbers to represent the
increasing size of the cores, making the RG-6 considerably thicker than the
RG-59. Both cable types use F-type terminators.

RG 59 Cable

This device will also split a cable. There are a few configurations available
depending on your needs. However as you know, there is always a caveat. If you
are splitting RJ-45, there should be no decrease in performance since you have 8
wires available and the connection will use 4 wires (normal) for the first PC
and the other 4 for the second. However, there will be a problem if you split an
RG-6 or RG-59 coaxial (TV) connection. The splitter will split the speed evenly
to each device. Depending on the amount of signal you have to begin with, one
split generally isn’t a problem. However, your next split will take the 50% it
receives and send 25% each to the downline devices. Image quality or performance
issues may arise at this point.
Cable Jackets

Safety is your number one concern when running network cabling. This concerns
not only the usual such as dangling cables or running too close to power lines,
but also the materials you are using. The construction of the network cable you
are running is something you may not consider, but when examining cables you
will find that the outer sheath generally consists of one or two types of
material, PVC (PolyVinylChloride) or Plenum grade. Incorrect usage of these two
types could result in you having to rewire your entire installation. PVC is
cheaper and is perfectly suitable for patch cables and exposed wiring, but once
you run inside a dropped ceiling or any location that moves air, plenum grade
cabling is required by most states. PVC releases toxic fumes when ignited and it
is easily combustible. Plenum cable is less flammable than PVC and mandatory
wherever ventilation is present. Plenum cable will be clearly marked.

=== Speed and transmission limitations

== Video cables
Video Cables

Video cables connect a specific type of video port on a computer to a display.
Each has its own connector type and cable pin-out.

Video Cables

We’ll discuss display connector types and cables. When using today’s PCs, the
flat panel monitor is the way to go. When working in the field however, you will
encounter a mix of older CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) monitors and TFT (Thin Film
Transistor) flat panels which have a clear crisp resolution and deep rich
colors. Most of the improvements you see in monitors today are the result of the
greater number of pixels in the display combined with the tens of thousands of
colors each individual pixel can produce. The color bit depth of the earliest
monitors, or the number of colors the monitor can display, was 16 which was
pretty good for 1984.

But now each individual pixel can produce over 16.5 million colors, making
graphics look beautiful, realistic, and lifelike. So what does this have to do
with connectors? When you think about it, the original monitors were
monochromatic and as a result, didn’t have a heavy data load. These early
monitors would only need to show mostly text and one color over black. As the
display complexity increased, new interfaces were designed to support the
increased amount of data.

=== VGA
VGA— VGA cables connect older analog Video Graphics Adapters to a display. It
uses a 15-pin connector arranged in three rows of five pins.

VGA (HD15), RCA, & BNC

The naming of the VGA connector has been updated to include HD-15 or DB-15,
signifying the high density capabilities of the connector and the cable. VGA is
a 15-pin male connector although some older, high-end PCs used 5 BNC coaxial
connectors, with each BNC cable carrying one color or synchronization signal, to
improve picture quality. RCA cables have been used to carry analog component
video.

HDMI—HDMI cables connect a High Definition Multimedia Interface to a display. It
uses a 19-pin connector arranged in two rows. There are different types of HDMI
cables. The most commonly used is type A but is usually just referred to as an
HDMI cable with no type designation.

=== Mini-HDMI
Mini-HDMI—HDMI type C is usually referred to as mini-HDMI. It uses a 19-pin
connector arranged in two rows, like the HDMI type A cable, but it is smaller
and the pin-out is different.

Mini-HDMI
Smaller size connection for HDMI (same
Micro-HDMI
Even smaller size
=== DisplayPort
DisplayPort—DisplayPort cables connect a DisplayPort interface to a display. It
uses a 20-pin connector arranged in two rows of ten pins.

DisplayPort & miniHDMI

The DisplayPort interface and cable are designed to replace the older VGA and
DVI connections. An interesting note is that on a DisplayPort adapter, you will
often find a VGA or DVI interface on it for flexibility.

The newest video interface introduced is HDMI (High Definition Multimedia
Interface). This evolution of video controller is also capable of carrying
device control information to compatible devices, allowing you to control your
video player, game system, monitor, and multichannel audio amplifier through a
single device via the HDMI connector. The HDMI connector and cable are available
in two configurations, standard and miniHDMI (these are compared in the table).
Often, you will find the standard HDMI connector on a PC or monitor and the
miniHDMI connector on a camera or gaming system.

Display port

Technically, the Mini-DisplayPort is still a dongle in the general sense of the
term. The DisplayPort interface allows ultra-high resolution, 3D, and data
connectivity but not sound as of this current version of the test objectives.

During the lifespan of DisplayPort, another high resolution technology called
Thunderbolt was released . To avoid confusion, Thunderbolt connectors were
designed to support all the features of DisplayPort. When connected, Thunderbolt
has the advantage of chaining Thunderbolt devices together through a single
interface. The Thunderbolt data transfer rate exceeds USB 3.0 and FireWire 800.
The Thunderbolt (PCI-Express) signaling uses two dedicated channels which
provide isolation for the send and receive signals. While being physically
identical to the DisplayPort, the Thunderbolt connector and port can be
identified by the Thunderbolt logo present on both the connector and the port.

DVI (DVI-D/DVI-I)—DVI cables connect a Digital Visual Interface interface to a display. DVI-D (-D for digital) supports only digital signals. DVI-I (-I for integrated) supports digital and analog signals. There are single-link and dual-link DVI cables. Single-link DVI supports 3.7 Gbps HDTV at 60 frames per second. Dual-link DVI supports 7.4 Gbps HDTV at 85 frames per second.

There are two types of connectors: DVI-I
=== DVI-D / DVI-I
DVI D – I – A

We will discuss the connectors that you need to know. We’ll look first at the
DVI connector and cable. This connector comes in three configurations and is
capable of carrying digital signals, analog signals, or both depending on the
type. DVI-D carries digital signals only, DVI-A carries analog signals only, and
DVI-I carries digital and/or analog signals.

We can convert any signal to any other signal
DVI to HDMI, HDMI to Mini-HDMI, etc., any digital signal requires a simple

== Multipurpose cables
Multipurpose Cables

Connecting devices directly together without a network connection can be done
with these cables.

• Multipurpose cables

A dongle is a connector that allows a peripheral device to connect with other
devices. An example is an RJ-45 dongle that has PC compatible connectors. Shown
below is an RJ-45-to-Thunderbolt dongle that we’ll discuss later. It might be a
little hard to make out but notice the small Thunderbolt logo on top of the
smaller connector to the PC.


=== Lightning
Lightning—Lightning cables are proprietary to Apple™. They are used to connect
Apple™ devices to USB ports. The cable has eight wires and is terminated with a
USB connector on one end and a Lightning connector on the other. It can carry
both data and power to charge the device. The Lightning connector is reversible,
so it can be plugged into the device without regard to which side is up.

Apple proprietary connector
Provides power and data
Typically to connect Apple phones and tablets
8 Pins
 
 
=== Thunderbolt
Thunderbolt—Thunderbolt is another Apple™-proprietary cable. It comes as either
copper or optical cable. The maximum length is 3 meters for copper and 60 meters
for optical cable. The connectors are based on the Mini DisplayPort standard,
  except Thunderbolt version 3 uses a USB-C connector on the peripheral end. It
  provides both data and power to peripheral devices, most commonly storage and
  display devices. There are three versions of Thunderbolt. Total throughput for
  Thunderbolt 1 and 2 is 20 Gbps and Thunderbolt 3 is 40 Gbps.

Thunderbolt

Currently we have USB 3.0, running at 5Gbps, which is fast! However, faster
still is the Thunderbolt card connection. For a time, Thunderbolt was only
available to Mac users. Fortunately, Thunderbolt is available to all.
Thunderbolt takes advantage of its low-latency/ high-bandwidth design to achieve
theoretical speeds of 20 Gb/sec, through two channels, although your mileage may
vary. This technology has been crucial to the 4K/UHD revolution. The 4K/2K
maximum resolution is 4096 x 2160 and is the maximum resolution of 4K Ultra HD.
4K Ultra HD should be seen to be fully appreciated as it is similar to your
first HD TV experience, but times FOUR!!!

PCIe x1 Internal Thunderbolt card
Display cable types

For the A+ test, you will be expected to know about the following cable types.
You will also need to be able to identify the pre-USB mouse and keyboard
connectors that use the miniDIN 6-pin connector.

PC connector types and cables

Thunderbolt Ethernet Adapter by Apple

When Wi-Fi was still a novelty for the average consumer, Wi-Fi dongles permitted
Wi-Fi access to devices that didn’t originally have it. When 802.11b devices
needed to be upgraded to 802.11g or 802.11n, Wi-Fi dongles were used to
accomplish this. Bluetooth adaptation is another area where rather than buying a
new laptop, a user can simply add a Bluetooth dongle. For Mac users, there is a
USB alternative through the DisplayPort. Here is a full-size look at a laptop’s
DisplayPort.

Thunderbolt
Apple proprietary connector

signals
Thunderbolt 1 and 2 use the same connector as
a Mini DisplayPort
 
 
Thunderbolt 3 uses the same connection as USB
C
 

=== USB
USB—Universal Serial Bus cables connect to a wide variety of peripheral devices.
USB 1.1 was the first version in common use. It uses a type-A connector on the
PC side and a type-B connector on the peripheral side. There are also mini and
micro connectors for smaller devices such as cell phones and cameras. It
supports two speeds. Low speed supports data transfer rate of 1.5 Mbps at
lengths up to 3 meters. Full speed supports data transfer rates of 12 Mbps at
lengths up to 5 meters. It provides power, as well.

USB Connectors

Next we see USB and the various cable configurations. First is the USB A Male
connector which is the machine end of a standard USB 1.0-to-2.0 cable. The USB
3.0 cable end will be identical in size and shape, but is colored blue to
differentiate it from the older versions. USB extension cables are available and
will have a USB A Male connector on one end and a USB A Female on the other
end.

On a standard USB 1.0-to-2.0 cable, the devices will connect using a USB B Male
connector. As the selection of USB connectable devices grew, these devices also
became smaller which called for a new, smaller connection type. For example, the
USB A connector ended up being larger than the new cell phones and tablets that
it needed to connect to. These smaller connectors started with the Mini A
connection which have been deprecated in favor of the Micro connection. The
Micro connection is half the height of the Mini, making the Micro connectors
1.8mm high.

Peripheral Cables

Peripheral cables are used to connect a PC to other devices.

A parallel cable sends multiple bits at the same
time.
Parallel cables are used to connect to printers.
Parallel cables are no longer popular, but they
=== Serial
Serial—While there are many types of serial cables, the term “serial cable”
usually refers to a specific type of cable that confirms to the RS-232
specification. Serial cables are most often used to connect a laptop to the
console or management port of a network device, such as a switch, router, or
firewall.

A serial cable communicates via a serial protocol
(sends data one bit at a time)
The maximum length is 15 m
The two most common serial cable connections
are DE-9, which contains 9 wires
Most laptops don’t have serial connections
Most desktops have serial connections
 
A common use of a serial cable is to connect to
a piece of network or industrial equipment and
configure it.
 
A popular cable is a DB-9 to RJ-45 cable, known
as a console cable.  It is used to connect to and
configure network equipment such as Cisco

== Hard drive cables
Hard Drive Cables

Hard drive cables connect a hard drive to a motherboard or controller card. The
same cables may also be used to connect optical drives and older floppy drives.


=== SATA
SATA—The Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) cable is the most commonly
used hard drive cable. There are different SATA revisions. They all allow a
maximum cable length of one meter. SATA revisions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.2 support
speeds of 1.5 Gbps, 3 Gbps, 6 Gbps, and 16 Gbps, respectively.

SATA & eSATA connectors

This connection uses Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) for internal
drive connections such as hard disks and optical drives. SATA is the replacement
for Parallel ATA (PATA) which was the preceding primary drive connection method.
  Because of its flexibility, the SATA interface can connect externally to the
  machine using an eSATA port. In the table, you can see the internal SATA data
  and power connectors. Many SATA devices ship with a MOLEX-to-SATA adapter
  cable for power. eSATA connects external devices. You can distinguish SATA
  from eSATA by noting the L-shaped SATA connector. The eSATA connector has a
  straight rectangular interface and an external rib on each side of the plug
  which prevents improper insertion.

A SATA cable is the current method of
connecting Hard Disk Drives in consumer
electronics
The current version is 3.3
SATA is backwards compatible with older
versions
Supports speeds of up to 6 Gbps (burst) and
600 Mbps (average speed)
A SATA data connector contains seven pins  
 
The seven-pin SATA connector on a hard disk
drive is on the left.  The fifteen-pin SATA power
connector on a hard disk drive is on the right.
 
Notice that a few of the pins are longer.  They

=== SCSI
SCSI—Small Computer System Interface was designed to support a wide variety of
device types, so there are different types of SCSI cables. They may be ribbon
cables or standard round cables of 50, 68, or 80 wires. Up to 16 devices,
including the motherboard or SCSI controller card, may be connected to one SCSI
cable or daisy-chained together.
Adapters

Adapters may be used to connect a device to a port that is different from the
connector on the device. They are most often used to connect to a display or a
network.

Adapters and converters
USB A to USB B & USB to Ethernet

In this section, we will look at the adapters and converters that can be used to
modify the connection type from one to another. You will find two basic
configurations: one single adapter where each end has the desired connector and
the other configuration where both connections are attached to a short length of
cable (a dongle).  

Adapters and converters are extremely useful, with USB type adapters and
converters being the most common. You can find a USB adapter or converter to
modify practically anything. Consider a one piece USB adapter that converts an
RJ-45 Ethernet cable to USB. A little device like this can save you from having
to replace the hardware in a desktop or can help you add functionality to a
machine that does not have an Ethernet adapter. One of the earliest adapters of
this type was the PS/2-to-USB adapter. This came with new (at the time) mice,
allowing you to connect a USB mouse via your PS/2 connection. During this time,
USB ports were uncommon and if you had USB capability on your machine, you
probably only had two ports.

If you need to change the “gender” of a USB port, it is possible using the USB
B-to-A Adapter which is shown in the table below. This helps if you need to
connect to a USB B device and, like most of us, have a cable collection
consisting of only USB A cables. You will be all set with no loss in capability
or performance! This is also indispensable if you need to add length to an
existing cable.
DVI to HDMI and to VGA & Thunderbolt to DVI

Now we’ll move onto video converters and adapters. There is no shortage of video
converters and adapters although your only real concern is to not send digital
signals over an analog connection. This is not really an issue for the most part
as the signal is converted before transmission and these adapters are not
manufactured. This is a good way to differentiate between these components.

An adapter is a component that basically rewires the connection from one pin
configuration and shape to the desired pinout and shape. A converter adapts the
configuration AND modifies the electrical properties of the signal being carried
to the desired format.

For example, DVI-to-VGA is an area where the digital versus analog issue will
present itself. VGA uses analog signaling whereas DVI is capable of either. You
have to be careful. The VGA (or DE-15) interface is an analog-only connection
type and digital signals are not handled. Make sure you have a DVI-A connection
which is analog only or as a second choice, DVI-I which is integrated to carry
either digital or analog. In the latter case, look at to the graphics adapter
settings to be sure. That aside, all you need is the little adapter shown below.
There are also digital-to-analog and vice-versa converters available should you
find yourself stuck.

Next, let’s consider DVI to HDMI. These data formats are compatible although DVI
is unable to carry the audio signal.

Next, let’s consider HDMI to VGA. Since we’ve established that VGA is analog and
that HDMI is digital, a converter is needed as you can see by the small brick at
the cable end of the image. However, it gets the job done!

The last entry in our list of goodies is the Thunderbolt-to-DVI adapter. This is
an interesting case because of the multiport compatibility between the
Thunderbolt interface and the MiniDisplayPort (mDP). These two interfaces are
very closely designed and are almost, but not completely, interchangeable.
Thunderbolt uses the same connector as the mDP and for the purposes of this
comparison, the differences are insignificant. Since the DVI connection and the
Thunderbolt/mDP connection are both digital, only an adapter is necessary. No
converter is needed.
