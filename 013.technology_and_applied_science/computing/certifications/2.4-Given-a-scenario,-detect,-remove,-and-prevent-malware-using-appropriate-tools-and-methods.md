Malware (scenario)

To succeed on questions about malware, you should be able to evaluate a given scenario, find malware, and remove it with effective tools and procedures. You should also know how to prevent malware in the future.
What Is Malware?

The term malware is used to describe any malicious software that includes (but is not limited to) trojans, spyware, viruses, and worms. Let’s take a deeper look at some of the different types of malware that exist today.
Ransomware

Ransomware was given its name because it essentially holds your files and data ransom until you pay the attacker. As the popularity of cryptocurrency (such as bitcoin) has grown, so has ransomware. This is because now attackers can request bitcoin as their method of payment to release the data after a ransomware attack making the attackers more difficult to track down.
Trojan

Trojans are malicious programs that disguise themselves as valuable programs. Imagine a scenario where a user downloads a program that they believe will allow them to listen to music or watch a movie for free. They download the program because they believe it to be a valuable and legitimate program. However, when they go to run the program, they have actually installed malware on their device. This is an example of a trojan.
Keylogger

Some attacks will try to install keyloggers onto a user’s computer in order to steal private data, passwords, or credit card numbers. Keyloggers come in both hardware and software forms. A keylogger will track all of the keystrokes made on the computer running the keylogger. This information can then be transmitted over to the attack for them to parse looking for useful stolen information.
Rootkit

Rootkits are malicious programs with the goal of gaining privileged access to a computer. Rootkits hide themselves by taking advantage of operating system functions, and they can attack operating systems, hypervisors, and firmware.
Virus

A virus is defined as any malicious program that replicates itself and attempts to infect other computers. Viruses, unlike worms, need human interaction to spread. They are only able to replicate to other drives on the same computer and not across the network. Viruses could have many different goals from corrupting data to stealing information.
Botnet

When an attacker gains full control of a system and they plan to use that system to carry out other attacks (such as a DDOS attack), that computer becomes a bot. The infected computer is essentially a zombie, as it’s no longer under the control of its owner, but rather it is under the control of the attacker. A botnet is a large group of these bot computers that can be used to carry out various attacks such as sending spam or performing a denial-of-service attack.
Worm

A worm is similar to a virus. The feature that separates a worm from a virus is that a worm can replicate itself without any user intervention.
Spyware

Spyware is a type of malware that covertly collects data on a user after it is installed on their computer.
Tools and Methods
Antivirus

Many threats described above can be mitigated simply by having an antivirus program installed. Antivirus is made up of two main components, the antivirus engine and the antivirus database. The antivirus engine is responsible for real-time scanning. The antivirus definitions database is a repository of signatures used to detect known malware.
Anti-Malware

Anti-malware software is extremely similar to antivirus, but it takes the detection a step farther. Anti-malware software can usually check files outside of the windows file systems such as those on malicious websites and those coming in via email.
Recovery Console

Windows offers a suite of built in recovery tools known as the Windows® Recovery Console. This console can be especially helpful if a computer has been infected by malware. Some of the tools in the recovery console will allow you to reset the operating system back to default or simply restore the computer to an earlier time (such as before the computer become infected.)
Backup/Restore

Sometimes, an attack occurs and the only way to resolve the issue and remove the risk is to completely wipe the computer and start fresh. When this happens, users may lose all of their data on the hard drive. Losing data can be a huge burden for an organization. This is where backup/restore comes in. Important files should always be backed up. In cases of ransomware, files may be encrypted and deemed unusable. Rather than pay the attacker to restore your data, you could simply reformat those devices and restore the data that you have backed up.
End User Education

While there are plenty of wonderful tools out there to help protect against attacks, end user education is one of the most important. This is because antivirus software and spam filters are not perfect. It is important for users to understand what types of items they should download and not download, what types of websites they should not visit, and how to identify a phishing scam.
Software Firewalls

When referring to software firewalls in this section, we are referring to firewalls that come as part of the operating system. Windows® computers come with a built-in software firewall called Windows® Defender Firewall. This firewall can help prevent against worms and malicious inbound connections.
DNS Configuration

One way to prevent users from navigating to malicious URLs is to implement a filtered DNS service. When filtered DNS is configured and a user tries to access a malicious URL they will receive a page stating that the content is not reachable due to a policy that was put in place.



Welcome to ExamNotes by CertBlaster! This edition brings us to A plus 1002 sub-objective 2.4 where we will discuss how to detect, remove, and prevent malware using appropriate tools and methods. These threats are not operating system specific (unless noted) and can affect most platforms and circumstances as you will see. You will also see the cost of non-compliance with policies or practices. Here we go!

Malware

Malware is a generalized term that describes anything that intentionally causes harm or damage in the operating environment.  The symptoms encountered due to Malware are often clues to the type of attack being fought. The items listed below categorize these attack types.
Ransomware

Ransomware is a malicious program that blocks access to the system and the data until a ransom is paid. Ransomware can be installed on the system by accessing an infected or compromised website, downloading a malicious file, or opening a malicious email attachment or hyperlink. A pop-up may appear that informs the user of a block and includes instructions on what to do next. The block may look like it is from a police or law enforcement agency. Newer ransomware infections can even modify the MBR and/or encrypt the hard drive contents (crypto-ware).

In order to unlock the computer, an amount of money must be paid in the specified anonymous manner and the user must hope that an unlock or decryption key is sent. Immediately power off the machine upon discovery of ransomware since it takes time to encrypt the files. This will lessen the impact of the encryption.
Trojans

Trojans are fundamentally infected versions of real files. Be careful with what has been downloaded and scan it before it is opened or installed. This is particularly important when dealing with email attachments.

Trojans are designed to do any number of things. Trojans can delete files, compromise system information, and even grant access and control of the machine to the perpetrator. The symptoms of a system infected by Trojans include poor performance, increased or bogged down network and/or servers, and generally unpredictable behavior accompanied by new or deleted files in the system which often cause system failure.

KEYLOGGER
Rootkits

Rootkits are a particularly sinister malware variant. A rootkit infects a computer and grants the rootkit’s owner privileged access to the target PC without the user’s knowledge or consent. The defense against rootkits is to always keep the protection software up-to-date and to apply any and all security patches to the OS. Rootkits are usually well hidden and undetectable by conventional means. There are Rootkit detection packages available but rootkits are often hidden inside system files where detection is impossible. This makes prevention the primary defense. Download only from trusted sources and be cautious of emails from unknown sources.
Virus

New virus attacks are practically a daily occurrence. Viruses infect the system with the desired malicious payload and also replicate themselves onto connected devices. Viruses can spread over a network or through infected writable devices that are shared. Always write protect a USB thumb drive before inserting it into a system lest it becomes infected. A virus will reveal its presence on a system through increased network activity, sluggish system performance, or possibly by tricking the unsuspecting user with a false warning similar to the one shown below. If you ever see this message, DO NOT click okay and certainly DO NOT call anyone.

False warning

If you encounter this error message, use Ctrl-Alt-Del to launch the Task Manager or Command-Option-Esc on a Mac to launch Force Quit and kill the browser instance(s). If that fails, power off the system immediately. Then reboot and perform a virus scan immediately. This is a typical malware trick. If you agree to the false warning message, you will be asked to install harmful software under the guise that it will help clean the system. If you call the phone number, you will ultimately be asked to allow the technician to take over your machine.

A symptom of virus infection is the inability to reach anti-virus and anti-virus sites. Norton, Symantec, and McAfee programs will not be able to reach their servers nor will you. Shown below is an anti-malware program that is unable to connect to its update server. Note the unable to access message in the white field in the screenshot below.

Server access fail

In the worst case, even the built-in safeguards are unable to update. Shown below is a Windows Defender update attempt on an infected machine. Note the progress after an hour and a half. Although it has not failed officially, the update is not going to finish.

Zombie/botnet

When discussing a Zombie and its relationship to a botnet, picture an army of zombies. In addition, imagine your PC as one of potentially millions of PCs infected with the same malware that is commandeered by a single host. The entity that controls the botnet can literally use the infected machines towards a single purpose such as DDoS, Spam, or Malware distribution. Hundreds of billions of dollars in losses/damage can be attributed to botnets.
Worms

Worms attack connected devices and other network hosts by exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system. Compared to Viruses and Trojans, a Worm will consume network bandwidth and overload network servers. The primary purpose of a Worm is to replicate itself to every possible node on a given network. Upon suspicion of a Worm infection, disconnect the computer from the network and/or Internet. Running the antivirus program after booting to a repair disk or into Safe Mode will help. In order to prevent this type of attack, keep the protection signatures up-to-date and avoid opening odd email attachments.
Spyware

Spyware is software that is installed on a device without the consent of the user, collecting user data and sending it to a third party. These programs can monitor and record keystrokes, browsing information including login data, credit card numbers, and passwords or PINs. Confidential information can easily be compromised. It is important to have adequate defenses. Built into Windows is Windows Defender, offering real-time protection and background AV scanning.

Windows defender

A layered approach can be considered when dealing with malware. This type of protection is also available in paid or premium versions of protection packages. Be careful when selecting products for system defense as programs commonly installed with the OS can conflict with purchased protection products. Also, avoid freeware that is unfamiliar as some programs are “wolves in sheep’s clothing” and contain malicious payloads.
Tools and methods

Antivirus/antimalware

The best way to repair an infected machine is by booting to an antivirus repair disk or USB Drive. This process allows the system to boot to the repair media and to thoroughly scan the system before any system files or malware programs have a chance to launch. If a repair disk hasn’t been made, make one now. In the absence of a repair disk, scan the system in safe mode with the primary AV solution. Here is a look at Norton 360.

Norton Full Scan

Norton 360 was supplied by the ISP, no doubt to address their inability to control the issue (sorry, Norton is an added value!) Whenever possible, perform a Full scan. Scan as much as possible. Browser files and Temp files are hiding spots for malware so ensure these locations get checked. If a scan is going to be performed, do a full scan as opposed to a quick one.

Recovery console

The current Windows RE replaced the recovery console and provides additional features to repair the system. For systems with startup problems, the updated F8 boot menu will provide options and allow access to the Advanced startup options shown below. For functioning operating systems, use the Control Panel > Recovery option and choose Restart now under Advanced startup. This grants access to the Command Prompt, Restore from a restore point, System image recover, and Startup settings.j

Advanced options

Backup/restore

In addition to File History, Windows 10 retains the Windows 7 backup and Restore utility which allows backups and system images to be stored on another disk or on the network. When needed, these backups can be restored to their original locations. This utility can also create a system repair disk.

Backup and Restore

End-user education

The end-user is considered the weakest link in any protection plan. It is extremely important to make the end-user aware of the threats to their system. Always take time to explain the cause of any problems you have resolved. Give the end-user tools to protect themselves. Something as simple as hovering the mouse cursor over a link in order to view the actual web address can easily prevent an infection. Make sure the end-user knows how to update their A/V program as well as their operating system. Show them how to set schedules for these updates if necessary.

Software firewalls

Windows Defender Firewall provides good protection for PCs when it is configured properly. It provides protection and notifications for traffic on both Public and Private networks. For portable devices, the Public settings should be carefully reviewed. You can allow or block incoming/outgoing traffic entirely or allow certain apps or features through. The advanced settings provide precise control over the firewall activity, allowing you to control each inbound and outbound rule. You’ll probably be surprised at the number of rules. Shown below is the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security window. A portion of the inbound rules is being displayed.

SecureDNS

Secure DNS is useful in combating Phishing attacks. This service is most effective when the IP configuration uses settings specifically recommended by the ISP. That does it for 2.4! See you in 2.5! Good luck on the test!
