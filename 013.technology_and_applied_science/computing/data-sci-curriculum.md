# Data Scientist

[Mathematics Curriculum](mathematics-curriculum.md)
[Mathematics](00-mathematics-index.md)
[CS Links](cs-links.md)


## Math for Data Science

## Applied part
1. Acquaintance with Numpy [Numpy Tutorial on Scipy-Lectures](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/index.html)
2. Pandas tutorial [Official tutorial](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html)
3. Matplotlib [Intro to Matplotlib](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/matplotlib/index.html)

## Machine Learning
1. Machine Learning Open Course (https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai)
2. CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (http://cs231n.github.io/)
3. Fast.ai - sequence of 4 practice-oriented courses [Courses page](https://www.fast.ai/)

## Deep Learning
1. Deepearning.ai (specialization on Coursera https://www.deeplearning.ai/)

## Natural Language Processing
1. Best NLP competitions on Kaggle to learn from: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nH4OSyjwSI) by Abhishek Thakur

## Computer Science and Software Engineering
This is where I refer to a collection by jwasham's [coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)  
Special courses to take listed separately:
1. Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science [MIT's 6.0002](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/index.htm)
2. Algorithms: Design and Analysis [Stanford Course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+Algorithms1+SelfPaced/about)
3. Machine Learning [Stanford Course by Andrew Ng](http://cs229.stanford.edu/)
4. Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization (a sequence of 6 courses; specialization on Coursera https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)
5. Object-Oriented Programming and Design Patterns in Python (https://www.coursera.org/learn/oop-patterns-python/)
6. C++ *learning by doing*<br>
  I have found these sources to be useful especially used in conjunction with each other:
- [C++ video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT1RFoTVtIAw5rR4izBKH2Z2PtUblVpXT) - very good explanation (in Russian)
- [C++ lessons](https://ravesli.com/uroki-cpp/) (in Russian)
7. Java<br>
- Cool in-depth coverage of Java Core: [Golovach Courses](https://www.youtube.com/user/KharkovITCourses/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=12) (in Russian)
8. System design - engineering approach [very cool collection](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
9. Learn to work with the [command line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line)

## Other Interesting Courses
Some of the courses with the useful material to get a grasp of:
1. Topics in Mathematics with Applications in Finance (topics include stochastic calculus, stochastic differential equations, time series analysis, and direct applications to finance) [MIT's 18.S096](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s096-topics-in-mathematics-with-applications-in-finance-fall-2013/index.htm)

## Useful Resources
- Linear Algebra and Learning from Data [Book by Gilbert Strang](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/learningfromdata/)
- Good collection of data science resources [awesome-datascience](https://github.com/academic/awesome-datascience)
- Growing set of Kaggle kernels with emphasis on practice [awesome-kaggle-kernels](https://github.com/alfarias/awesome-kaggle-kernels)
- [Vector Derivatives Notes](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~csip/tirgul3_derivatives.pdf)
- [Colah's blog](https://colah.github.io/) on machine learning
