line to match, otherwise just a literal $
extended regex characters:
* - one or more of the previous pattern
? - the preceding pattern is optional
{ } - specify minimum, maximum or exact matches of the previous pattern
| - alternation - a logical "or"
( ) used to create groups

passwd field order: username:password status:change date:minimum:maximum:warn:inactive
field: example: meaning
user name: sysadmin: the name of the user
password status: P: P indicates a usable password, L indicates a locked password, NP indicates no password
