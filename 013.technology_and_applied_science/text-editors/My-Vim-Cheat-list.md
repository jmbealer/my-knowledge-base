### Insert Mode Commands <inserting>

The following commands can be used to insert new text into the buffer. They can
all be undone and repeated with the "." command.

- a - [N] a
  - Append text after the cursor [N times]
    - Append text after the cursor [count] times.
  - If the cursor is in the first column of an empty line Insert starts there.
  - But not when 'virtualedit' is set!
- A - [N] A
  - Append text at the end of the line [N times].
    - Append text at the end of the line [count] times.
- i - [N] A or \<insert>
  - Insert text before the cursor [N times]. (also: \<Insert>)
    - Insert text before the cursor [count] times.
  - When using CTRL-O IN Insert mode i CTRL-O the count is not supported.
- I - [N] A
  - Insert text before the first non-blank in the line [N times].
    - Insert text before the first non-blank in the line [count] time.
  - When the 'H' flag is present in 'cpoptions' and the line only contains
      blank, insert start just before the last blank.
- gI - [N] gI
  - Insert text in column 1 [N times].
    - Insert text in column 1 [count] times.
- gi - [N] gi
  - Insert text in the same position as where Insert mode was stopped last time
      in the current buffer.
  - This uses the '^ mark.
  - It's different from "\`^i" when the mark is past the end of the line.
  - The position is corrected for inserted/deleted lines, but not for
      inserted/deleted characters.
  - When the :keepjumps command modifier is used the '^ mark won't be changed.
- o - [N] o
  - open a new line below the current line, append text [N times]
    - Begin a new line below the cursor and insert text, repeat [count] times.
  - When '#' flag is in 'cpoptions' the count is ignored.
- O - [N] O
  - open a new line above the current line, append text [N times]
    - Begin a new line above the cursor and insert text, repeat [count] times.
  - When '#' flag is in 'cpoptions' the count is ignored.

### `[Operator][Count][Motion]`

- Operators are actions. These are like verbs of a sentence when "speaking Vim"
  - verbs: the operation you want to take on the text
- Motions provide context to your Operators. These execute the action in a
    particular way.
  - nouns
- Counts are optional and simply let you put a multiplier to your command and
    motion.

- text objects
  - iw "inner word" (works from anywhere in a word)
  - it "inner tag" (the contents of an HTML tag)
  - i" "inner quotes"
  - ip "inner paragraph"
  - as "a sentence"

- **s** [count] words backwards. exclusive motion.
- **t**
- **n**
- **b** [count] words forward. exclusive motion.

### Notation <notation>

- [] - Characters in square brackets are optional.
- [count] - An optional number that may precede the command to multiply or
    iterate the command.
  - If no number is given, a count of one is used, unless otherwise noted.
  - You can use \<Del> to erase the last digit (N\<Del>).
- ["x] <[quotex]> - An optional register designation where text can be stored.
  - The x is a single character between:
    - 'a' and 'z' or 'A' and 'Z' or '"'
    - Some cases (with the put command) between '0' and '9', '%', '#' or others.
  - The uppercase and lowercase letter designate the same register
  - But the lowercase letter is used to overwrite the previous register contents
  - While the uppercase letter is used to append the previous register contents.
  - Without the ""x" or with """" the stored text is put into the unnamed
      register.
- {}
  - Curly braces denote parts of the command which must appear, but which can
      take a number of different values.
  - The differences between Vim and Vi are also given in curly braces.
- {char1-char2}
  - A single character from the range char1 to char2.
  - For example: {a-z} is a lowercase letter.
  - Multiple ranges may be concatenated.
  - For example: {a-zA-Z0-9} is any alphanumeric character.
- {motion} <movement>
  - A command that moves the cursor.
  - This is used after an operator command to move over the text that is to be
      operated upon.
  - If the motion includes a count and the operator also has a count, the two
      counts are multiplied.
    - For example: "2d3w" deletes six words.
  - The motion can be backwards.
    - For example: "db" to delete to the start of the word.
  - The motion can also be a mouse click.
    - The mouse is not supported in every terminal though.
  - The ":omap" command can be used to map characters while an operator is
      pending.
  - Ex commands can be used to move the cursor.
    - This can be
- {Visual}
- \<character>
- 'c'
- CTRL-{char}
- 'option'
- "command"
