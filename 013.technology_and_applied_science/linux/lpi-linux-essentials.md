# LPI Linux Essentials

The purpose of the Linux Essentials Certificate is to define the basic knowledge
required to competently use a desktop or mobile device using a Linux Operating
System.

## Candidate Description

This is a description of a candidate that is just barely qualified to pass the
Linux Essentials exam.  This hypothetical person is called the Minimally
Qualified Candidate (MQC).  Standards on the Linux Essentials exam should be set
so that this person (and anyone more able) would pass but anyone less able would
not pass.

The Linux Essentials MQC should have rudimentary skills or knowledge in the
following topics:

- Free and Open Source Software, the various communities and licenses
- Processes, programs and the components of an operating system
- Computer hardware
- System security, users/groups and file permissions for public and private
directories
- Make the system accessible and able to connect to other computers on a Local
Area Network (LAN)
- Open Source Applications in the workplace as they relate to closed source
equivalents
- File system browsers on a Linux Desktop
- Where to go for help
- Work on the command line and with files
- Make and restore simple backups and archives
- Use a basic command line editor
- File compression
- Create and run simple shell scripts

/etc  Host-specific system-wide configuration files.

There has been controversy over the meaning of the name itself. In early versions of the UNIX Implementation Document from Bell Labs, /etc is referred to as the etcetera directory,[4] as this directory historically held everything that did not belong elsewhere (however, the FHS restricts /etc to static configuration files and may not contain binaries).[5] Since the publication of early documentation, the directory name has been re-explained in various ways. Recent interpretations include backronyms such as "Editable Text Configuration" or "Extended Tool Chest".[6]
/etc/opt  Configuration files for add-on packages stored in /opt.
/etc/sgml  Configuration files, such as catalogs, for software that processes SGML.
/etc/X11  Configuration files for the X Window System, version 11.

/home  Users' home directories, containing saved files, personal settings, etc.
/lib  Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin and /sbin.
/lib<qual>  Alternate format essential libraries. These are typically used on systems that support more than one executable code format, such as systems supporting 32-bit and 64-bit versions of an instruction set. Such directories are optional, but if they exist, they have some requirements.
/media  Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs (appeared in FHS-2.3 in 2004).
/mnt  Temporarily mounted filesystems.
/opt  Add-on application software packages.[7]
/proc  Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files. In Linux, corresponds to a procfs mount. Generally, automatically generated and populated by the system, on the fly.
/root  Home directory for the root user.
/run  Run-time variable data: Information about the running system since last boot, e.g., currently logged-in users and running daemons. Files under this directory must be either removed or truncated at the beginning of the boot process, but this is not necessary on systems that provide this directory as a temporary filesystem (tmpfs) (appeared in FHS-3.0 in 2015).
/sbin  Essential system binaries (e.g., fsck, init, route).
/srv  Site-specific data served by this system, such as data and scripts for web servers, data offered by FTP servers, and repositories for version control systems (appeared in FHS-2.3 in 2004).
/sys  Contains information about devices, drivers, and some kernel features.[8]
/tmp  Directory for temporary files (see also /var/tmp). Often not preserved between system reboots and may be severely size-restricted.
/usr  Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user utilities and applications. Should be shareable and read-only.[9][10]
/usr/bin  Non-essential command binaries (not needed in single-user mode); for all users.
/usr/include  Standard include files.

/usr/lib<qual>  Alternative-format libraries (e.g., /usr/lib32 for 32-bit libraries on a 64-bit machine (optional)).
/usr/local  Tertiary hierarchy for local data, specific to this host. Typically has further subdirectories (e.g., bin, lib, share).[NB 1]
/usr/sbin  Non-essential system binaries (e.g., daemons for various network services).
/usr/share  Architecture-independent (shared) data.
/usr/src  Source code (e.g., the kernel source code with its header files).
/usr/X11R6  X Window System, Version 11, Release 6 (up to FHS-2.3, optional).
/var  Variable files: files whose content is expected to continually change during normal operation of the system, such as logs, spool files, and temporary e-mail files.
/var/cache  Application cache data. Such data are locally generated as a result of time-consuming I/O or calculation. The application must be able to regenerate or restore the data. The cached files can be deleted without loss of data.
/var/lib  State information. Persistent data modified by programs as they run (e.g., databases, packaging system metadata, etc.).
/var/lock  Lock files. Files keeping track of resources currently in use.
/var/log  Log files. Various logs.
/var/mail  Mailbox files. In some distributions, these files may be located in the deprecated /var/spool/mail.
/var/opt  Variable data from add-on packages that are stored in /opt.
/var/run  Run-time variable data. This directory contains system information data describing the system since it was booted.[11]

In FHS 3.0, /var/run is replaced by /run; a system should either continue to provide a /var/run directory or provide a symbolic link from /var/run to /run for backwards compatibility.[12]
/var/spool  Spool for tasks waiting to be processed (e.g., print queues and outgoing mail queue).
/var/spool/mail  Deprecated location for users' mailboxes.[13]
/var/tmp  Temporary files to be preserved between reboots.
