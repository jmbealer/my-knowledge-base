Introduction

Open Source Essentials is an education and certificate program that covers the fundamental aspects of free and open source software, open content and open technology. It includes topics from various professions, including legal, technical and business aspects. The program is not limited to a specific profession. Instead, it covers the common knowledge that anyone who is professionally involved with open source should have. This common knowledge allows developers, managers, lawyers and any other professional working in the field of open source to communicate, share a common perspective and terminology, and collaborate successfully. This program also allows individuals to understand the concepts behind open source and engage with the open source community.

Preamble

As part of LPIâ€™s Essentials program, Open Source Essentials includes learning materials, a proctored exam and a certificate. It serves as an education program as well as a credential to prove a specific set of skills and knowledge.

Open Source Essentials can be used in numerous applications, such as:

    a shared common body of knowledge for all professionals working in an Open Source Program Office (OSPO).
    a requirement for software development companies to ensure they understand and follow best practices when developing open source software and communities.
    an internal education program to educate developers, consultants or sales representatives about open source software.
    a proof of specialization to any kind of profession that is related to or interacts with the field of open source software.
