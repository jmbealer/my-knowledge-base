# Python-regex
== Python RegEx WIP

A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.
RegEx Module

Python has a built-in package called re, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.

Import the re module:
import re
RegEx in Python

When you have imported the re module, you can start using regular expressions:
Example

Search the string to see if it starts with "The" and ends with "Spain":
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("^The.*Spain$", txt)
RegEx Functions

The re module offers a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match:
Function 	Description
findall 	Returns a list containing all matches
search 	Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string
split 	Returns a list where the string has been split at each match
sub 	Replaces one or many matches with a string
Metacharacters

Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:
Character 	Description 	Example 	Try it
[] 	A set of characters 	"[a-m]"
\ 	Signals a special sequence (can also be used to escape special characters) 	"\d"
. 	Any character (except newline character) 	"he..o"
^ 	Starts with 	"^hello"
$ 	Ends with 	"world$"
* 	Zero or more occurrences 	"aix*"
+ 	One or more occurrences 	"aix+"
{} 	Exactly the specified number of occurrences 	"al{2}"
| 	Either or 	"falls|stays"
() 	Capture and group
Special Sequences
<!--ID: 1639528995128-->


A special sequence is a \ followed by one of the characters in the list below, and has a special meaning:
Character 	Description 	Example 	Try it
\A 	Returns a match if the specified characters are at the beginning of the string 	"\AThe"
\b 	Returns a match where the specified characters are at the beginning or at the end of a word
(the "r" in the beginning is making sure that the string is being treated as a "raw string") 	r"\bain"
r"ain\b"

\B 	Returns a match where the specified characters are present, but NOT at the beginning (or at the end) of a word
(the "r" in the beginning is making sure that the string is being treated as a "raw string") 	r"\Bain"
r"ain\B"

\d 	Returns a match where the string contains digits (numbers from 0-9) 	"\d"
\D 	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain digits 	"\D"
\s 	Returns a match where the string contains a white space character 	"\s"
\S 	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain a white space character 	"\S"
\w 	Returns a match where the string contains any word characters (characters from a to Z, digits from 0-9, and the underscore _ character) 	"\w"
\W 	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain any word characters 	"\W"
\Z 	Returns a match if the specified characters are at the end of the string 	"Spain\Z"
Sets

A set is a set of characters inside a pair of square brackets [] with a special meaning:
Set 	Description 	Try it
[arn] 	Returns a match where one of the specified characters (a, r, or n) are present
[a-n] 	Returns a match for any lower case character, alphabetically between a and n
[^arn] 	Returns a match for any character EXCEPT a, r, and n
[0123] 	Returns a match where any of the specified digits (0, 1, 2, or 3) are present
[0-9] 	Returns a match for any digit between 0 and 9
[0-5][0-9] 	Returns a match for any two-digit numbers from 00 and 59
[a-zA-Z] 	Returns a match for any character alphabetically between a and z, lower case OR upper case
[+] 	In sets, +, *, ., |, (), $,{} has no special meaning, so [+] means: return a match for any + character in the string
 
The findall() Function

The findall() function returns a list containing all matches.
Example

Print a list of all matches:
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.findall("ai", txt)
print(x)

The list contains the matches in the order they are found.

If no matches are found, an empty list is returned:
Example

Return an empty list if no match was found:
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.findall("Portugal", txt)
print(x)
 
The search() Function

The search() function searches the string for a match, and returns a Match object if there is a match.

If there is more than one match, only the first occurrence of the match will be returned:
Example

Search for the first white-space character in the string:
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("\s", txt)

print("The first white-space character is located in position:", x.start())

If no matches are found, the value None is returned:
Example

Make a search that returns no match:
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("Portugal", txt)
print(x)
 
The split() Function

The split() function returns a list where the string has been split at each match:
Example

Split at each white-space character:
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.split("\s", txt)
print(x)

You can control the number of occurrences by specifying the maxsplit parameter:
Example

Split the string only at the first occurrence:
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.split("\s", txt, 1)
print(x)
 
The sub() Function

The sub() function replaces the matches with the text of your choice:
Example

Replace every white-space character with the number 9:
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.sub("\s", "9", txt)
print(x)

You can control the number of replacements by specifying the count parameter:
Example

Replace the first 2 occurrences:
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.sub("\s", "9", txt, 2)
print(x)
 
Match Object

A Match Object is an object containing information about the search and the result.

Note: If there is no match, the value None will be returned, instead of the Match Object.
Example

Do a search that will return a Match Object:
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("ai", txt)
print(x) \#this will print an object

The Match object has properties and methods used to retrieve information about the search, and the result:

.span() returns a tuple containing the start-, and end positions of the match.
.string returns the string passed into the function
.group() returns the part of the string where there was a match
Example

Print the position (start- and end-position) of the first match occurrence.

The regular expression looks for any words that starts with an upper case "S":
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search(r"\bS\w+", txt)
print(x.span())
Example

Print the string passed into the function:
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search(r"\bS\w+", txt)
print(x.string)
Example

Print the part of the string where there was a match.

The regular expression looks for any words that starts with an upper case "S":
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search(r"\bS\w+", txt)
print(x.group())

Note: If there is no match, the value None will be returned, instead of the Match Object.

Regular Expression

A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing).

    Python Regular Expression - Exercises, Practice, Solution

The following table provides a list and description of the special pattern matching characters that can be used in regular expressions.
Special
characters 	Description
. 	(Dot.) In the default mode, this matches any character except a newline. If the DOTALL flag has been specified, this matches any character including a newline.
^ 	(Caret.) Matches the beginning of the string or line. For example /^A/ does not match the 'A' in "about Articles" but does match it in "Articles of life"
$ 	Matches the end of the string or line. For example, /e$/ does not match the 't' in "exact", but does match it in "w3resource".
* 	Matches the previous character 0 or more times. For example, /bo*/ matches 'boo' in "A bootable usb" and 'b' in "A beautiful mind", but nothing in "A going concern".
+ 	Matches the previous character 1 or more times. For example, /a+/ matches the 'a' in "Daniel" and all the a's in "Daaam"
? 	Matches the previous character 0 or 1 time. For example, /r?eu?/ matches the 're' in "w3resource" and the 'eu' in "europe".
*?, +?, ?? 	The '*', '+', and '?' qualifiers are all greedy; they match as much text as possible. Sometimes this behaviour isn’t desired; if the RE <.*> is matched against '<a> b <c>', it will match the entire string, and not just '<a>'. Adding ? after the qualifier makes it perform the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few characters as possible will be matched. Using the RE <.*?> will match only '<a>'.
{m} 	Specifies that exactly m copies of the previous RE should be matched; fewer matches cause the entire RE not to match. For example, b{5} will match exactly five 'b' characters, but not four.
{m,n} 	Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE. For example, a{2,5} will match from 2 to 5 'a' characters. Omitting m specifies a lower bound of zero, and omitting n specifies an infinite upper bound. As an example, a{4,}b will match 'aaaab' or a thousand 'a' characters followed by a 'b', but not 'aaab'.
{m,n}? 	Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as few repetitions as possible. This is the non-greedy version of the previous qualifier. For example, on the 6-character string 'aaaaaa', a{3,5} will match 5 'a' characters, while a{3,5}? will only match 3 characters.

Either escapes special characters (permitting you to match characters like '*', '?', and so forth), or signals a special sequence; special sequences are discussed below.
[] 	Used to indicate a set of characters. In a set:

    Characters can be listed individually, e.g. [amk] will match 'a', 'm', or 'k'.
    Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-', for example [a-z] will match any lowercase ASCII letter, [0-5][0-9] will match all the two-digits numbers from 00 to 59, and [0-9A-Fa-f] will match any hexadecimal digit. If - is escaped (e.g. [a\-z]) or if it’s placed as the first or last character (e.g. [-a] or [a-]), it will match a literal '-'.
    Special characters lose their special meaning inside sets. For example, [(+*)] will match any of the literal characters '(', '+', '*', or ')'.
    Character classes such as \w or \S (defined below) are also accepted inside a set, although the characters they match depends on whether ASCII or LOCALE mode is in force.
    Characters that are not within a range can be matched by complementing the set. If the first character of the set is '^', all the characters that are not in the set will be matched. For example, [^5] will match any character except '5', and [^^] will match any character except '^'. ^ has no special meaning if it’s not the first character in the set.
    To match a literal ']' inside a set, precede it with a backslash, or place it at the beginning of the set. For example, both [()[\]{}] and []()[{}] will both match a parenthesis.
<!--ID: 1639528995170-->


| 	A|B, where A and B can be arbitrary REs, creates a regular expression that will match either A or B. An arbitrary number of REs can be separated by the '|' in this way. This can be used inside groups (see below) as well.
(...) 	Matches whatever regular expression is inside the parentheses, and indicates the start and end of a group; the contents of a group can be retrieved after a match has been performed, and can be matched later in the string with the \number special sequence, described below. To match the literals '(' or ')', use \( or \), or enclose them inside a character class: [(], [)].
(?...) 	This is an extension notation (a '?' following a '(' is not meaningful otherwise). The first character after the '?' determines what the meaning and further syntax of the construct is. Extensions usually do not create a new group; (?P<name>...) is the only exception to this rule. Following are the currently supported extensions.
(?aiLmsux) 	(One or more letters from the set 'a', 'i', 'L', 'm', 's', 'u', 'x'.) The group matches the empty string; the letters set the corresponding flags: re.A (ASCII-only matching), re.I (ignore case), re.L (locale dependent), re.M (multi-line), re.S (dot matches all), re.U (Unicode matching), and re.X (verbose), for the entire regular expression.
(?:...) 	A non-capturing version of regular parentheses. Matches whatever regular expression is inside the parentheses, but the substring matched by the group cannot be retrieved after performing a match or referenced later in the pattern.
(?imsx-imsx:...) 	(Zero or more letters from the set 'i', 'm', 's', 'x', optionally followed by '-' followed by one or more letters from the same set.) The letters set or removes the corresponding flags: re.I (ignore case), re.M (multi-line), re.S (dot matches all), and re.X (verbose), for the part of the expression.
(?P<name>...)

Similar to regular parentheses, but the substring matched by the group is accessible via the symbolic group name name. Group names must be valid Python identifiers, and each group name must be defined only once within a regular expression. A symbolic group is also a numbered group, just as if the group were not named.

Named groups can be referenced in three contexts. If the pattern is (?P<quote>['"]).*?(?P=quote) (i.e. matching a string quoted with either single or double quotes):
Context of reference to group “quote” 	Ways to reference it
in the same pattern itself

    (?P=quote) (as shown)
    \1

when processing match object m

    m.group('quote')
    m.end('quote') (etc.)

in a string passed to the repl argument of re.sub()

    \g<quote>
    \g<1>
    \1

(?P=name) 	A backreference to a named group; it matches whatever text was matched by the earlier group named name.
(?#...) 	A comment; the contents of the parentheses are simply ignored.
(?=...) 	Matches if ... matches next, but doesn’t consume any of the string. This is called a lookahead assertion. For example, Isaac (?=Asimov) will match 'Isaac ' only if it’s followed by 'Asimov'.
(?!...) 	Matches if ... doesn’t match next. This is a negative lookahead assertion. For example, Isaac (?!Asimov) will match 'Isaac ' only if it’s not followed by 'Asimov'.
(?<=...)

Matches if the current position in the string is preceded by a match for ... that ends at the current position. This is called a positive lookbehind assertion. (?<=abc)def will find a match in 'abcdef', since the lookbehind will back up 3 characters and check if the contained pattern matches.

>>> import re
>>> m = re.search('(?<=abc)def', 'abcdef')
>>> m.group(0)
'def'

This example looks for a word following a hyphen:

>>> m = re.search(r'(?<=-)\w+', 'spam-egg')
>>> m.group(0)
'egg'

(?<!...) 	Matches if the current position in the string is not preceded by a match for .... This is called a negative lookbehind assertion. Similar to positive lookbehind assertions, the contained pattern must only match strings of some fixed length. Patterns which start with negative lookbehind assertions may match at the beginning of the string being searched.
(?(id/name)yes-pattern|no-pattern) 	Will try to match with yes-pattern if the group with given id or name exists, and with no-pattern if it doesn’t. no-pattern is optional and can be omitted. For example, (<)?(\[email protected]\w+(?:\.\w+)+)(?(1)>|$) is a poor email matching pattern, which will match with '<[email protected]>' as well as '[email protected]', but not with '<[email protected]' nor '[email protected]>'. The special sequences consist of '\' and a character from the list below. If the ordinary character is not an ASCII digit or an ASCII letter, then the resulting RE will match the second character. For example, \$ matches the character '$'.
\number 	Matches the contents of the group of the same number. Groups are numbered starting from 1. For example, (.+) \1 matches 'the the' or '55 55', but not 'thethe' (note the space after the group). This special sequence can only be used to match one of the first 99 groups. If the first digit of number is 0, or number is 3 octal digits long, it will not be interpreted as a group match, but as the character with octal value number. Inside the '[' and ']' of a character class, all numeric escapes are treated as characters.
\A 	Matches only at the start of the string.
\b

Matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or end of a word. A word is defined as a sequence of word characters.
\B 	Matches the empty string, but only when it is not at the beginning or end of a word. This means that r'py\B' matches 'python', 'py3', 'py2', but not 'py', 'py.', or 'py!'. \B is just the opposite of \b, so word characters in Unicode patterns are Unicode alphanumerics or the underscore, although this can be changed by using the ASCII flag. Word boundaries are determined by the current locale if the LOCALE flag is used.
\d

Matches any character which is a digit. Equivalent to [0-9]. For example, /\d/ or /[0-9]/ matches '2' in "E2 means second example."
\D 	Matches any character which is not a decimal digit. This is the opposite of \d. If the ASCII flag is used this becomes the equivalent of [^0-9] (but the flag affects the entire regular expression, so in such cases using an explicit [^0-9] may be a better choice).
\s

Matches any white space character (including tab, new line, carriage return, form feed, vertical tab). [ \t\n\r\f\v].
For example, /\s\w*/ matches ' apple' in "An apple."

Matches characters considered whitespace in the ASCII character set; this is equivalent to [ \t\n\r\f\v].
\S 	Matches any character which is not a whitespace character. This is the opposite of \s. If the ASCII flag is used this becomes the equivalent of [^ \t\n\r\f\v] (but the flag affects the entire regular expression, so in such cases using an explicit [^ \t\n\r\f\v] may be a better choice).
\w

Matches characters considered alphanumeric in the ASCII character set; this is equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]. If the LOCALE flag is used, matches characters considered alphanumeric in the current locale and the underscore.
\W

Matches any non-word character, equivalent to [^A-Za-z0-9_]. For example, /\W/ or /[^$A-Za-z0-9_]/ matches '$' in "150$"
\Z 	Matches only at the end of the string.
