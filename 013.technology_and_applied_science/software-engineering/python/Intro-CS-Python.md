# Intro-CS-Python
represent knowledge with data structures
iteration and recursion as computational metaphors
abstraction of procedures and data types
organize and modularize systems using object classes and methods
different classes of algorithms, searching and sorting
complexity of algorithms

.Types of knowledge
declarative knowledge is statement of fact.
imperative knowledge is a recipe or "how-to".

.What is a recipe
sequence of simple steps.
flow of control process that specifies when each step is executed.
a means of determining when to stop
algorithm

python program is a sequence of commands (called statements) for the Python
interpreter to executed.
loop is a sequence of statements preform multiple time

false, true, true, false, true, true, true, true, false, false
b, d, a, c, b, b, b, b, a, d

expressions are fragment of program code that produce or calculate new data values
literal is used to indicate a specific value

print(<expr>, <expr>, ..., <expr>) print()
print(<expr>, <expr>, ..., <expr>, end='\n') print()
<variable> = <expr>
<variable> = input(<prompt>)
  <prompt> string expressions that prompt the user for input
<var1>, <var2, ..., <varN> = <expr1>, <expr2, ..., <exprN>
for <var> in <sequence>: <body>
