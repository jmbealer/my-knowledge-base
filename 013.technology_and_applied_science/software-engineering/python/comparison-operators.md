# Comparison (Relational) Operators `==, !=, >, <, >=, <=`

Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
Python Comparison Operators are used to compare the values on both sides.

A comparison operator in python, also called python relational operator, compares the values of two operands and returns True or False based on whether the condition is met. We have six of these, including and limited to- less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, equal to, and not equal to. So, letâ€™s begin with the Python Comparison operators.


Comparison (Relational) Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=); compares the values of
two operands and returns True or False base on whether the condition is met.

.Python Comparison (Relational) Operators:
 == Equal To Operator; If the two operand's values are equal, then the condition becomes True, otherwise False.
x==y True if x is exactly equal to y, if not False

!= Not Equal To Operator; If the two operand's values are not equal, then the condition becomes True, otherwise False.
x!=y 	True if x is exactly not equal to y, otherwise False
Both the operators define the same meaning and function.
Note that the operator <> for the same purpose is no longer functional.

> Greater Than Operator; If the value of the left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then the condition becomes True, otherwise False.
x>y True if x (left-hand argument) is greater than y (right-hand argument), otherwise False.

< Less Than Operator; If the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, then the condition becomes True. otherwise False.
x<y True if x (left-hand argument) is less than y (right-hand argument), otherwise False.

<= Less Than Equal To Operator If the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then the condition becomes true, otherwise False.
x<=y 	True if x (left-hand argument) is less than or equal to y (right-hand argument), otherwise False.

>= Greater Than Equal To Operator; If the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then the condition becomes true, otherwise False.
x>=y 	True if x (left-hand argument) is greater than or equal to y (left-hand
argument), otherwise False.
