# Float

immutable
Float also called Floating-point numbers.
Floats represent real numbers with a decimal point
Floats can be use to represent fractional quantities and precise measurements.
Floats have a maximum sizes
When the maximum float is reached, Python returns inf
When the minimum float is reached, Python returns -inf
inf represent infinity.
-inf represent negative infinity.

E notation represent exponential notation.
use to represent numbers that too big to fit on the screen.
E notation used to display large floating-point numbers
the number before of e is multiplied by 10 raised to the power of the number after e
  "e" to indicate the power of 10.
1e6 is equivalent to 1x10^6
+ sign indicates that the exponent is a positive number.
- sign indicates that the exponent is a negative number.
E notation:<value>e<exponent>

.Float Examples:
x = 1.5 # Float
y = -1.5 # Float
z = 0.0 # Float


x = 35e+3 # 35000.0
x = 35e-3 # 0.035
