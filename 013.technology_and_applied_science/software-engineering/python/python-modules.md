# Python-modules
== Python Modules WIP
What is a Module?

Consider a module to be the same as a code library.

A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
Create a Module

To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py:
Example

Save this code in a file named mymodule.py
def greeting(name):
  print("Hello, " + name)
Use a Module

Now we can use the module we just created, by using the import statement:
Example

Import the module named mymodule, and call the greeting function:
import mymodule

mymodule.greeting("Jonathan")

Note: When using a function from a module, use the syntax: module_name.function_name.
Variables in Module

The module can contain functions, as already described, but also variables of all types (arrays, dictionaries, objects etc):
Example

Save this code in the file mymodule.py
person1 = {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 36,
  "country": "Norway"
}
Example

Import the module named mymodule, and access the person1 dictionary:
import mymodule

a = mymodule.person1["age"]
print(a)
Naming a Module

You can name the module file whatever you like, but it must have the file extension .py
Re-naming a Module

You can create an alias when you import a module, by using the as keyword:
Example

Create an alias for mymodule called mx:
import mymodule as mx

a = mx.person1["age"]
print(a)
Built-in Modules

There are several built-in modules in Python, which you can import whenever you like.
Example

Import and use the platform module:
import platform

x = platform.system()
print(x)
Using the dir() Function

There is a built-in function to list all the function names (or variable names) in a module. The dir() function:
Example

List all the defined names belonging to the platform module:
import platform

x = dir(platform)
print(x)

Note: The dir() function can be used on all modules, also the ones you create yourself.
Import From Module

You can choose to import only parts from a module, by using the from keyword.
Example

The module named mymodule has one function and one dictionary:
def greeting(name):
  print("Hello, " + name)

person1 = {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 36,
  "country": "Norway"
}
Example

Import only the person1 dictionary from the module:
from mymodule import person1

print (person1["age"])

Note: When importing using the from keyword, do not use the module name when referring to elements in the module. Example: person1["age"], not mymodule.person1["age"]



Date and Time in Python

Python provides a module named datetime to deal with dates and times.

It allows you to set date ,time or both date and time using the date(),time()and datetime() functions respectively, after importing the datetime module .
import datetime
feb_16_2019 = datetime.date(year=2019, month=2, day=16)
feb_16_2019 = datetime.date(2019, 2, 16)
print(feb_16_2019) \#2019-02-16

time_13_48min_5sec = datetime.time(hour=13, minute=48, second=5)
time_13_48min_5sec = datetime.time(13, 48, 5)
print(time_13_48min_5sec) \#13:48:05

timestamp= datetime.datetime(year=2019, month=2, day=16, hour=13, minute=48, second=5)
timestamp = datetime.datetime(2019, 2, 16, 13, 48, 5)
print (timestamp) \#2019-01-02 13:48:05
Aliasing with ‘as’ keyword

In Python, the as keyword can be used to give an alternative name as an alias for a Python module or function.
\# Aliasing matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.plot(x, y)

\# Aliasing calendar as c
import calendar as c
print(c.month_name[1])
Import Python Modules

The Python import statement can be used to import Python modules from other files.

Modules can be imported in three different ways: import module, from module import functions, or from module import *. from module import * is discouraged, as it can lead to a cluttered local namespace and can make the namespace unclear.
\# Three different ways to import modules:
\# First way
import module
module.function()

\# Second way
from module import function
function()

\# Third way
from module import *
function()
random.randint() and random.choice()

In Python, the random module offers methods to simulate non-deterministic behavior in selecting a random number from a range and choosing a random item from a list.

The randint() method provides a uniform random selection from a range of integers. The choice() method provides a uniform selection of a random element from a sequence.
\# Returns a random integer N in a given range, such that start <= N <= end
\# random.randint(start, end)
r1 = random.randint(0, 10)  
print(r1) \# Random integer where 0 <= r1 <= 10

\# Prints a random element from a sequence
seq = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
r2 = random.choice(seq)
print(r2) \# Random element in the sequence
Module importing

In Python, you can import and use the content of another file using import filename, provided that it is in the same folder as the current file you are writing.
\# file1 content
\# def f1_function():
\#	  return "Hello World"

\# file2
import file1

\# Now we can use f1_function, because we imported file1
f1_function()
