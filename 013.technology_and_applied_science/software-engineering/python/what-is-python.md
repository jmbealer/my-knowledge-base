- Created in 1991 by Guido Van Rossum
- Named after Monty Python’s Flying Circus
- Is an interpreted, Object-Oriented, High Level Programming Language with
    dynamic semantics.
- Gained popularity because of its clear syntax and readability

Python **IDLE**: Integrated Development Environment

- executes instructions one line at a time.

is dynamically-typed, and garbage-collected language

## What Makes Python so Powerful?

**PyPI**: Python Package Index

- It is a repository of third-party Python modules
- you can install it using a program called pip.
- Run the following command in Command Prompt:
  - pip install library_name

### Python Architecture

Let’s now talk about Python architecture and its usual flow –

**Parser**:
It uses the source code to generate an abstract syntax tree.

**Compiler**:
It turns the abstract syntax tree into Python bytecode.

**Interpreter**:
It executes the code line by line in a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) fashion.
It is interpreted(executed) line by line. This makes it easy to test and debug.
