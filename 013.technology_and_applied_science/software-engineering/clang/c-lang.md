Make programs that focus on a single, simple task (Unix Philosophy)
Make your programs small and simple (KISS principle)
Make programs that can interact with or be used by other programs (Unix Philosophy)
Give your programs a help (-h) and version (-v or -V) command
Use semantic versioning
Use git
Many small and simple functions are better than a few huge functions
Comment your code
