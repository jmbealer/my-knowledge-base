# Productive

  Decide exactly what you want to get accomplished and develop a clear vision
  Write it down
  Set a deadline on your goal and try to beat it
  List the steps necessary to achieve your task
  Organize the list into a plan and prioritize which tasks are the most important
  Take action on your plan immediately
  Do something everyday to move closer to that goal

Lists
  Sketch out your goals for the year
  Write down your goals for the month
  Each week write down what you need to accomplished
  List everything you need to get done the following day

Prioritize the list ABCD Method
  A Task - Urgent and Important, Something you must do. because if you don't there could be seriousnegative consequences
    finishing a lab report
    studying for your o-chen final
    preparing a speech for a presentation
  B Task - "Important but not Urgent", Something you should do. this is not as important as your A Tasks, minor negative consequences
  C Task - Urgent but not Important
  D Task - Neither Important nor Urgent
  Can also rank them ex: A-1, A-2, A-3
  Focus your attention on No more than 3 important tasks
  Accomplish your most important or hardest tasks first
  Work your way down A-E
    If you have A and B tasks remaining you would not complete a D or E Tasks first
