forgetting curve

Here again are the twenty rules of formulating knowledge. You will notice that the first 16 rules revolve around making memories simple! Some of the rules strongly overlap. For example: do not learn if you do not understand is a form of applying the minimum information principle which again is a way of making things simple:

    Do not learn if you do not understand
    Learn before you memorize - build the picture of the whole before you dismember it into simple items in SuperMemo. If the whole shows holes, review it again!
    Build upon the basics - never jump both feet into a complex manual because you may never see the end. Well remembered basics will help the remaining knowledge easily fit in
    Stick to the minimum information principle - if you continue forgetting an item, try to make it as simple as possible. If it does not help, see the remaining rules (cloze deletion, graphics, mnemonic techniques, converting sets into enumerations, etc.)
    Cloze deletion is easy and effective - completing a deleted word or phrase is not only an effective way of learning. Most of all, it greatly speeds up formulating knowledge and is highly recommended for beginners
    Use imagery - a picture is worth a thousand words
    Use mnemonic techniques - read about peg lists and mind maps. Study the books by Tony Buzan. Learn how to convert memories into funny pictures. You won't have problems with phone numbers and complex figures
    Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion - obstructing parts of a picture is great for learning anatomy, geography and more
    Avoid sets - larger sets are virtually un-memorizable unless you convert them into enumerations!
    Avoid enumerations - enumerations are also hard to remember but can be dealt with using cloze deletion
    Combat interference - even the simplest items can be completely intractable if they are similar to other items. Use examples, context cues, vivid illustrations, refer to emotions, and to your personal life
    Optimize wording - like you reduce mathematical equations, you can reduce complex sentences into smart, compact and enjoyable maxims
    Refer to other memories - building memories on other memories generates a coherent and hermetic structure that forgetting is less likely to affect. Build upon the basics and use planned redundancy to fill in the gaps
    Personalize and provide examples - personalization might be the most effective way of building upon other memories. Your personal life is a gold mine of facts and events to refer to. As long as you build a collection for yourself, use personalization richly to build upon well established memories
    Rely on emotional states - emotions are related to memories. If you learn a fact in the sate of sadness, you are more likely to recall it if when you are sad. Some memories can induce emotions and help you employ this property of the brain in remembering
    Context cues simplify wording - providing context is a way of simplifying memories, building upon earlier knowledge and avoiding interference
    Redundancy does not contradict minimum information principle - some forms of redundancy are welcome. There is little harm in memorizing the same fact as viewed from different angles. Passive and active approach is particularly practicable in learning word-pairs. Memorizing derivation steps in problem solving is a way towards boosting your intellectual powers!
    Provide sources - sources help you manage the learning process, updating your knowledge, judging its reliability, or importance
    Provide date stamping - time stamping is useful for volatile knowledge that changes in time
    Prioritize - effective learning is all about prioritizing. In incremental reading you can start from badly formulated knowledge and improve its shape as you proceed with learning (in proportion to the cost of inappropriate formulation). If need be, you can review pieces of knowledge again, split it into parts, reformulate, reprioritize, or delete. See 


The goal: How to retain/comprehend more with less time spent:

Part 1: Concept Learning

Learn by teaching ie. rubber duck debugging, the Feynman technique

    Attempt to convey it clearly to someone else. Write down or verbally describe [to a friend- real or imagined, a wall, a teddy bear] the concept in the simplest terms possible.

    Scrutinize it; make notes on the things you haven’t covered, can’t explain clearly, the ‘how’s and ‘why’s coming up you can’t answer, etc.

    Repeat until your explanation and conveyance is thorough and comes easily.

Practice information retrieval This is a general skill that applies to both memorizing and concepts, but it’s key for recall during tests and highly recommended by universities especially for exams, etc.

    Put the learning materials away. After [at least] an hour - write down/draw diagrams of everything you can think of on blank paper. (Take this opportunity to fill in gaps in your info.) Another way to practice information retrieval is by creating mini practice tests about what you learned the week before and swapping with classmates.

    Do this once a week in various capacities to exercise the skill of recall, which is as important as memorizing the info itself.

Turn the abstract into concrete

    We remember things better when we take them from being abstract vocabulary and ideas and attach them to a concrete example.

    Both the definition and the scenario are comprehensible, but one is generally more easy to visualize.
    Eg. ‘Perpetual inventory system’ 
    When described as a scenario: “When you buy something on Amazon, the warehouse computer automatically shows there’s 1 less item to sell, and 1 more item to restock.” When described by definition: “A method of accounting for inventory that records the sale or purchase of inventory immediately through the use of computerized point-of-sale systems software.” NOTE: You do want to be sure you memorize the formal definitions, too, but this helps for learning concepts more easily.

Prior to class: make outlines and understand objectives

    Determine the core learning objectives by familiarizing yourself with the chapter and the discussion questions before the lesson. (Studies show students who read about the material before going to class retained more of the information they learned and were able to apply it better.)

    Highlight headlines and identify key concepts + areas you struggle with prior to class.

Ask the right questions when practicing these techniques

    First, read the discussion questions, understand the objectives.

    Then when studying, write notes to compare and contrast, analyze, clarify, so that you’re actively engaging with the material, ex:

“What’s the difference between?”

“Why does this happen and that doesn’t?”

“What is the importance of…?”

“What is the connection between?”

Part 2: Memorizing Techniques

Spaced repetition whether via *Brainscape, flashcards, written notes, etc.

    Break your information into concise pieces

    Review for less than 25 mins, going over harder material more often.

    Review again after an interval of 20-60 mins, then use the forgetting curve to review again after an interval of 24 hours, then after 72 hours have passed, then a week, then 2 weeks, a month, etc. so things become rote by the time you need them (ie. midterms and final exams).

*Brainscape is a free website that allows you to build decks of flashcards. It then shows you what to review day-by-day based on your personal recall strengths/challenges and the overall human forgetting curve.

Common mnemonics

    Create an acronym, or borrow one: “Dear King Philippe Came Over For Good Soup” > Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species is one used in biology.

    Can be applied to rhyming and musical (like a commercial jingle) mnemonics. 

Memory palace

    Have your grocery list, a paragraph, a set of flash cards, etc. in front of you.

    Think of a place you’re familiar with- a room, a house, a town, etc.

    Plan out a route, thinking about each feature.

    Take one or two items at a time; a sentence or sentence fragment if it’s a literary article, parts of an equation if it’s math, etc. and place them along your route.

    Pair each item with an object, exaggerate it, interact with it- make it humorous, make it memorable. (Eg. if you’re memorizing parts of an equation like > “2(x+3)=(4x-1)/2+7” and the first image is of your front door- picture yourself solving the first part of the equation to enter the door, if you have a mirror to your left- picture it as blurry until you solve the next step, and so on.)

Part 3: Study and Focus Tactics

Time Management & Focus

    Put your study time to good use. Set a timer for around 30 minutes (or whatever works best for you) and focus completely on the material. No messaging, no reddit, no answering texts from your boyfriend or best friend, etc. Then allow yourself a 5-10 minute break to answer texts, get coffee, etc.

    Check your concentration (esp with dense information) by stopping after every page to restate the main idea and sub points to yourself in your own words. Draw a diagram, make sure your notes reflect anything that you need to clarify, etc. Bonus! Pairing your notes with images or diagrams so you have two points of reference for recall- think intently about how an image pertains to the information, reverse the process, then make your own doodle/diagram of the information.

    Keep a piece of scrap paper to your side- if something unrelated to study pops into your head, write it down and deal with it during an interval.

Separately schedule both homework time (for each individual class) and study time (to review notes from previous weeks for eventual exams) each week to make sure you’re getting both done.
