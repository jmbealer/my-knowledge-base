# Learning
Deliberate Practice: focused practice with a certain goal in mind
  How you are doing it
  What may be going wrong
  What to do to get bette

Active Recall
  Foundation Best method for learning
    Active Reading is testing your self as your reading.
    After reading a couple (2 or so) paragraphs look away (or close the book) then ask your self these questions
      What have I just read
      What are the key ideas
      Can I rephrase this in my own words
Spaced Repetition
Memory
Mind Mapping

output = input
concepts
facts

Note-taking
  put it in your own words
  big ideas - summaries, overviews, or conclusions
  bullet lists
  terms and definitions
  examples
Note-taking Methods
  Outline Method
    1) Main Idea 1
      a) Subtopic
        -Example
        -Example
      b) Subtopic
        -Details
        -Example
    2) Main Idea 2
      a) Subtopic
      b) Subtopic

  Cornell Method
    Cues (step 2)           Notes (step 1)
      reduce                  record
              Summary (step 3)
              reflect & review
  Mind Map Method
    use it to go over a concept to test if and how much i know of it

Hieracy of Competence
  Unconscious Incompetence (Wrong Intuition): "I don't know what I don't know."
  Conscious Incompetence (Wrong Analysis): "I know what I don't know."
  Conscious Competence (Right Analysis): "I grow and know and it starts to shows."
  Unconscious Competence (Right Intuition) "I simpl go because of what I know."

  Conscious Competence of Unconscious Incompetence


Experts at the Louisiana State University’s Center for Academic Success recommends 30–50 minutes sessions.

“Anything less than 30 is just not enough, but anything more than 50 is too much information for your brain to take in at one time,” says learning strategies graduate assistant Ellen Dunn.

SMART Goals

Closed-book spider diagrams

STic
  Spacing Testing Interleaving Categorising

minimizing distractions;maximizing focus
developing accurate metacognition
deep, appropriate processing of critical concepts
practicing retrieval and application

principles for achieving deep processing
  elaboration means making meaningful associations between the concept you are studying and related concepts.
    how does this concept relate to other concepts?
      the meaningful associations you can make, the better you will learn
  distinctivemess means that you make clear contrasts between the concepts you are studying and other concepts
    how is this concept different from other concepts?
      understand the key differences among related concepts
  personal
    how can i relate this concept to my personal experience?
  appropriate to retrieval and application means practice recalling the informations and using the infromation in the way that your teacher expect you to be able to do
    how am i expected to use or apply this concept?

automaticity a process so highly practiced that it occurs without any conscious effort
overlearning continuing to study beyond just knowing information to where it can be recalled quickly and easily

strategies for achieving deep processing
  question generation
    make the question as meanigful as possible.
    questions about facts are ok, but questions that make you compare and contrast , analyze, make connections, to think about implications or generate examples are even better
  concept map is a diagram of nodes and links
  practice retrieveing information in way teacher expects
    practice recalling without referring to notes or book
    practice using the information in way the teacher expects
      test for facts
      test for concepts

taking notes in class key concepts, key distinctions, and key relationships
  provide a key summary
  creates a set of memory cues
  engages you in the class
