= Test Strategies

Glance over the test
Answer the easy questions first
Carefully read the questions
  read twice
rephrase the question so you understand
know the remaining time
anticipate the correct answer before looking
draw diagrams if necessary
circle key words in the question
use you time to go back and review
read every answer option
use the process of elimination
for all of the above questions
  you don't have to know if all the answers are correct, just if more than one
  are correct
