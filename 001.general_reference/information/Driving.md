Right-of-way and Obligations

In many communities, driving is unfortunately a very chaotic experience. Most people are very self-centered and believe that others should always yield to them so that they can go first. For obvious reasons, this is not a viable way for traffic to operate. Various levels of government, from federal to state and local, have established right-of-way rules to govern traffic in a safe, efficient way. Most right-of-way laws are consistent across the country, though state and local governments have the ability to supersede these laws in some situations. One example is in passing emergency vehicles stopped on the side of the road - it is always best to move to the far lane and slow down to make sure that you are passing safely. Some states, including Texas, will have specific requirements for how far ahead you are required to change lanes and how much you need to slow down. The specific requirement may vary a little by state. Some states do not even have this as a requirement, just as a suggestion/safe practice. The important thing to recognize is that some standards may vary slightly by state and community, so you must be aware of the local laws that exist where you are driving. This section will go over national right-of-way standards in general and Texas right-of-way standards in particular.

Right-of-way rules establish who may (and should) go when. Without common guidelines, chaos would ensue. There are some situations in which other drivers will have to yield to you and other times where you will have to yield to them. To “yield” means to give the right-of-way to another driver and allow them to go.

Something that surprises many people about right-of-way laws is that they do not dictate who HAS the right-of-way, but who YIELDS the right-of-way. This may seem to be an unnecessary distinction, but it does help to put things in the proper perspective. Think of it this way: when you are following the right-of-way and going when it is your turn it is because someone else is allowing you to proceed. True, they are doing this because they are required to by law, but whether it is their choice or not, they are still allowing you to go. More importantly, wording things this way means that everyone is responsible for ensuring that the roads are safe, even if it is “their turn” to go.

Make sure you are actively searching to see that others are going to allow you to go if it is their job to yield to you. If you do not make sure that it is safe for you to proceed, then there is a much higher possibility that you will get in a wreck.

Though there are right-of-way standards for all driving situations, many times drivers do not follow them as they should. If someone does not follow these rules, always give them the right of way. They may be breaking the law by skipping ahead, but letting them go is the safest thing that you can do. It is much better to let someone else be “right” even if they are wrong if it saves life and property. Along the same lines, do not just go when it is your turn because it is your turn - make sure it is clear before you go. This allows for the mistakes of others and keeps both you and others safe. It is always better to be alive and uninjured than to be right.

Motorcycles and bicycles are classified as vehicles that hold the same rights and privileges as all other vehicles on the roadway. The biggest complaint of motorcyclists and bicyclists is that car drivers do not see them. Train yourself to look for more than just cars at intersections. Many cyclists are injured each year simply because drivers are only looking for a car. The cyclist is there, but the image the driver is looking for has four wheels. Anything less simply does not register in the driver’s brain. Be alert for movement and for a partial profile of a rider. Look for helmets, wheels, a head or an arm. Train your ears to listen for the sound of the motorcycle engine, which is often louder than a car engine.

== Bicycles - Here are the sections from the Texas Driver Handbook on bicycles that pertains to motorists:

    A bicycle is a vehicle and any person operating a bicycle has the rights and duties applicable to a driver operating a vehicle, unless it cannot, by its nature apply to a person operating a bicycle.
    A bicyclist should always obey all traffic laws, signs, and signals. Never ride opposite the flow of traffic. Stop at all stop signs and stop at red lights.
    A person operating a bicycle on a one-way roadway with two or more marked traffic lanes may ride as near as possible to the left curb or edge of the roadway.
    Persons riding two abreast shall not impede the normal and reasonable flow of traffic on the roadway.
    Persons riding two abreast on a laned roadway must ride in a single lane.
    No person riding a bicycle shall attach the same or himself to any streetcar or vehicle upon a roadway.





When required to come to a stop, make sure that you do so before entering the intersection. There are several devices that indicate where the intersection begins. Your entire vehicle must be behind these stop location indicators when you come to a stop. Please look for them in the following order:

    Stop line - A solid white line extending from the edge of the road across your lane indicating where you must stop. The placement varies a little, but is determined based upon what is safe for you, pedestrians, and other drivers. If present, it will always be before any of the other indicators.
    Marked crosswalk - If there is a marked crosswalk then you must stop before any portion of your vehicle enters the crosswalk in order to give pedestrians plenty of space to walk.
    Unmarked crosswalk - If there is a sidewalk or pedestrian path present, the intersection has a crosswalk, even if it is not marked. Draw an invisible line from the edge of the sidewalk closest to you across the street to where it would connect with the sidewalk on the other side. If there is a sidewalk present on only one side of the street, stop behind where the line would continue straight from the sidewalk. Make sure that none of your vehicle extends into the unmarked crosswalk.
    Edge of road with curb present - If there is no sidewalk, you must stop before the edge of the road, which is defined by the position of the curb.
    Edge of road without curb present - If there is no curb, you must stop before the edge of the road, which is defined by the pavement of the two roads joining together.
    Stop or Yield Sign - If none of the above indicators are present, which means you are driving on an unpaved road, then you need to stop at the stop sign itself. Many people choose to always stop at the sign itself as it simplifies things and the stop sign is often even with or before any of the other stop indicators. Unfortunately, this is not true in all instances and it does not help when coming to an intersection governed by a traffic signal rather than a stop or a yield sign.

Traffic Signals - Make sure to follow whatever the lights are telling you to do. When required to stop, make sure that you stop before you get into the intersection. Make sure that your vehicle does not move until the lights indicate that it is your turn and you are sure that it is safe to proceed. Do not begin to creep up in anticipation of when you believe that the light will change. This is running a red light, which is a serious traffic offense. If the traffic signals are not functioning properly, treat the intersection as a 4-way stop. If the lights are flashing red, it is functioning as a stop sign. If flashing yellow, approach with caution, but continue through the intersection if it is safe.

1-way or 2-way stop - At a 1-way or 2-way stop, the person with the stop sign must STOP, SEARCH, and YIELD before proceeding.

STOP - Make sure to come to a complete stop before you cross the stop location indicator. There are two methods to use to make sure that you have come to a complete stop. One method is to feel the vehicle settle back and then wait at least one second. Make sure that if you use this method, you pause for at least one to two seconds in order to make sure the vehicle settles completely. The second and clearest way is to look outside the vehicle, such as over the hood, and watch the ground come to a complete stop. When the ground has stopped moving, the vehicle has stopped moving. It is still best to wait for a second or two after stopping, but as long as the vehicle has stopped moving, you have fulfilled the legal requirement to STOP.

SEARCH - Search left, right, and then left again. This needs to be done first behind the line, crosswalk, or sidewalk to check for pedestrians. If there is a pedestrian present, yield to them. Once you are clear from pedestrians, make sure you are clear for vehicles as well. If you can clearly see the road, then this can be done at the same time as checking for pedestrians. If you cannot see the road clearly, then you can move forward past the stop line and/or into the crosswalk to make sure it is safe for you to proceed. You do not have to come to a complete stop a second time, unless you need to stop for safety.

YIELD - Simply put, this is allowing anyone else who has the right of way to go first. This includes pedestrians and other vehicles. When it is safe to go, you may proceed, provided you have already come to a stop and done a full search.

With the majority of 1-way or 2-way stops, you will have to move forward to make sure it is safe after you have stopped at the correct location. It is rare that you will come to a stop where you can see far enough to make sure it is safe without moving forward. Just make sure that you have stopped in the correct place first. When you move forward, try to not lean forward in your seat as this can endanger you from both decreasing our distance from the airbag and removing the full protection of your seat in the event of a collision.

3-way stop - These intersections are rare (unless there are only 3 roads present, in which case it is an all-way stop), though they appear in a few unusual situations. They may be present at the top of a long, steep hill instead of an all way stop so that the vehicle traveling up the hill does not have to stop at the top of the hill and potentially have problems if the road is icy or if they are driving a car with a manual transmission. Another example is in shopping centers off of high-volume roads where the incoming traffic does not stop so that there is not traffic backed up onto the busy road. In this case, yield to the traffic that does not stop and treat the other 3 sides as you would a four-way stop.

4-way or All-way stop - All-way stops confuse a lot of people. The biggest problem that most people have is that they tend to skip over the first of two factors which determine who has the right-of-way:

    Yield to those who arrive at the intersection before you do. Whoever gets there first goes first.
    If two vehicles arrive at the same time, the vehicle on the left yields to the vehicle on the right. Simply put, the vehicle on the right goes first. If there is a large volume of traffic at the intersection, continue to take turns, rotating in a clockwise fashion.

If two vehicles arrive at the same time while going opposite directions on the same road, follow the same rules which govern general driving. This means that if both drivers are turning right or going straight, they may proceed at the same time. If they are both turning left and do not pass the same path of travel, then they may go at the same time. If one is turning left and the other is going straight or right, then the one turning left must yield to the other driver.

Oftentimes, drivers will skip the first step, and jump right to the second. Sometimes, they will do something totally different that does not make sense to anyone else involved. In cases like this, allow the other driver to go first to avoid any potential accidents. Many times, another driver will wave you on. This is either due to the fact that they are friendly or, more likely, do not know what the rules are. It is usually best to go at their direction, though the legal requirement is the steps listed above and fault may be difficult to determine if an accident occurs in this situation.




A - Colors and Shapes of Signs, Signals, and Markings

In 1989, twice as many traffic accidents occurred at intersections with control devices than without. One explanation for this is false assumptions. Many drivers assume that because there is a traffic control device (i.e., traffic light, stop sign, one-way street sign, etc.), intersecting traffic will yield. We all know that a green traffic light means to proceed, and that a red traffic light means to stop. However, many things can affect whether these images will register on our brain: drugs, alcohol, stress, over-the-counter medication, fatigue, or just about any other distraction that there may be. Even our mood can affect whether we accurately respond to traffic signals or not. Get into the habit of making a quick glance left and right before traveling through an intersection, even when the light is green. Do not race into the intersection on the green light.

Traffic signals control the flow of traffic electronically using lights, symbols, and colors. The color scheme is familiar to almost everyone. Red always means stop, yellow indicates caution, and green tells you that it is safe to proceed. The common vertical orientation will always have red at the top, yellow in the middle, and green on the bottom. We will discuss the various lights and configurations in the next section of this chapter.

You may also see the standard traffic light in this horizontal orientation with red on the left and green on the right.

Traffic signs - These are samples from the three categories of signs. Note the colors and shapes and how they associate with each category. These identifiers can tell you about upcoming driving conditions from great distances, even before you can actually read the sign. The three categories are:

    REGULATORY: These signs regulate traffic by telling drivers what they can and cannot do. They are generally square or rectangular in shape. The color scheme will always be some combination of black, white and/or red.
    WARNING: These signs warn drivers of road conditions ahead and often require drivers to slow down. The shape is usually a diamond but there are exceptions. Colors include black on yellow, black on orange for construction zones, and the new black on fluorescent yellow-green for school zones. Fluorescent yellow green is visible from a much greater distance, especially in low visibility conditions and will phase in as the prevalent color for warning signs.
    INFORMATIONAL: These signs provide drivers with information, such as directions to highways, rest areas, scenic areas, hospitals, etc. The shape of these signs is usually rectangular. The color scheme is normally white on a blue, brown, or green background.


Some signs are distinct in their shape. Signs for stop, yield, school zone, railroad crossing, no passing, and highway identifiers have unique shapes that make them easily identifiable from a distance. The following section gives you a comprehensive look at U.S. signs and the information you may see on them.

    Red - means stop or prohibited
    White –regulation
    Black –regulation
    Yellow –warning
    Orange –construction/maintenance warning
    Green – direction guidance/movements are permitted
    Blue – motorist services guidance
    Brown - public recreation and scenic guidance


In addition, you can normally recognize common signs by their shape. Learning these shapes can help you judge what you are seeing well in advance.

    Octagon – only used for stop signs
    Rectangle (horizontal) – generally used for guide signs
    Triangle –yield signs only
    Pennant –no passing zone ahead
    Diamond – warning – an existing or a possible hazard on roadway or adjacent area
    Rectangle (vertical) – generally used for regulatory signs
    Pentagon –deals only with school zones or crossings
    Round – railroad advanced warning
    Road markings


Yellow lines indicate that traffic on the other side of the lines is traveling in the opposite direction.

White lines indicate that traffic on the other side of the lines is traveling in the same direction or marks the edge of the road. White is also used for stop limit lines and crosswalks.

Solid lines indicate that you cannot cross them under normal circumstances.

Dashed or dotted lines indicate you can cross over them to change lanes or pass another vehicle if it is safe. Smaller dots that are closer together indicate that the lane will become a merge-only lane soon.

B - Purpose and response for traffic control devices

Traffic signs help you to be safe and to be a better driver. Signs have 4 main purposes, according to the Texas Driver Handbook:

Right Arrow

    They WARN of hazards ahead that would otherwise be difficult to see
    The GUIDE drivers to their destination by identifying the route
    They INFORM of local regulations and practices
    They REGULATE the speed and movement of traffic


Traffic Signals - A steady red light indicates that you must stop before entering a crosswalk or intersection. Unless there is a sign prohibiting it, you may turn right on a red light after coming to a complete stop and yielding the right-of-way to all cross traffic, including pedestrians. If both streets are one-way and the situation allows for it, the same thing can be done for a left turn.
