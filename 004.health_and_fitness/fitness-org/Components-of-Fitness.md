# Components-of-Fitness
Componets of Fitness

    Body Composition - refers primarily to the distribution of muscle and fat in the body. Body size such as height, lengths and girths are also grouped under this componet.
    
    Muscular Strength - the ability to carry out work against a resistance.
        strength is the adaptation that leads to all other adaptations that you really care about
        power, speed, and agility are dependent on strength
        a well designed and balanced strength training decreases risk of sports injury
    
    Muscular Endurance - the ability to repeat a series of muscle contractions without fatiguing.
    
    Power - the ability to exert a maximal force in as short a time as possible, as in accelerating, jumping and throwing implements.
        combination of speed & strength
            increase power comes from higher force and not from higher velocity of training
        speed and agility are dependent upon power development
    
    Speed & Quickness - the ability to move quickly across the ground or move limbs rapidly to grab or throw.
        dependent upon strength & power
        reaction time: motor reaction to a signal
        movement time: ability to mave limb(s) quickly
        speed of running
    
    Agility - the ability to quickly change body positon or direction of the body.
        dependent of strength & power
        year round drills don not guarantee improvements
            due to stagnation since distance and intensity ar constant
        drills should be sport and position specific
    
    Flexibility - the capacity of a joint to move through its full range of motion, which is important for execution of the techniques of sports.
        dynamic stretches will be performed before speed, agility and power training, in addition to before sports practices and competitions
        any static flexibility work should be performed at end of workout
            the loss of voluntary strength and muscular power may last up to one hour after the static stretch
            only for areas suggested by the FMS to have low flexibility
        greater flexibility may impair performance in sports that do not require a high degree of flexibility
    
    Balance & Coordination - the ability to stay upright or stay in control of body movement, an important component of many sports skills.
    
    Cardiovascular Endurance - or aerobic fitness, stamina, is the ability to exercise continuously for extended periods without tiring.
        anaeorbic: includes sprinting, exercises, and drills less between 30-60 seconds
        aerobic: includes running and drills greater than 3 minutes
    
    Motor Skill - gross motor skills are basic skills developed when young, which can be developed upon with specific sports skills training
        develops an athletic coordination foundation
    
    
    Strength, Power, Speed, etc
        static strength is the force that can be held in one place (force)
            static strength = force
            examples: isometrics
        strength is the weight that can be move through a distance (work), or the ability of muscle to generate force against a resistance
            strength = force x distance
        power is the product of a force and the speed (power). power can be expressed by the work achieved in a unit time (asymptotic).power is a combination of strength & speed
            power = force x distance / time 
        speed is the distance travele per unit time without regard to direction (speed)
            speed = distance / time
        velocity is the speed and direction of an entity (velocity)
            velocity = speed & direction
        muscular endurance is the ablitiy to perform repetitive or sustained muscular contractions
        against some resistance for an exteded period of time
        
    Types of Muscular Endurance
        continuous tension 
            mountain climbing
            tug-of-war
            isometric contraction
            weight training
                very slow contraction
                isolated exercises
                compound exercises without a lock out
        repetitive dynamic contraction
            running
            rowing 
            weight training 
                high repetitions
                super sets with the same muscle
        prolonged intense contractions coupled with short rest periods 
            football 
            handball 
            weight training 
                multiple sets
                multiple exercises for the same muscle 
                circuit training
        components are not discrete. types of muscular endurance can be seen as a continuum of characteristics. for example, swimming requires components of continuous
        tension and repetitive dynamic tension. cycling is perdominately a repetitve dynamic contraction with slight continuous tension characteristics relative to running. in addition, many training protocols designed for continuous tension or repetitive dynamic contraction implement prolonged intense contractions coupled with short rest periods
        
    Types of Muscular Strength
        isometric contraction
            iron cross (gymnastics)
            tug-of-war 
        dynamic contraction 
            powerlifting (misnomer)
            weight training
        power contraction
            olympic style weightlifting
            shot put (field event)
            plyometrics
        components are no discrete. types of muscular strength can be seen as a continuum of characteristics. for example , slow contractions during weight training incorporate components of isometric contraction and dynamic contraction. in addition, all power lifting exercises require certain muscles to be isometrically contracted as well as dynamically contracted
