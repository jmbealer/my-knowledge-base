== Module 1: System Unit Hardware

Skills learned from this Lesson: Basic PC Operations, What is POST, BIOS/UEFI,
BIOS Components, BIOS Configuration, and Built-in Diagnostics

PC or Tower is the "System Unit"
* System Unit = CPU, Hard drives, memory, motherboard, and other internal
  components
* Provide processing and storage
* Basic usage involves inputting of information and its output
* Everything connects to the system is a peripheral. (two types)
** Input - mouse, keyboards, scanners, track pads, etc
** Output - monitors, printers, speakers, projectors

POST - Power On Self Test
When the system unit is powered on, the CPU checks throughout the motherboards
and verifies that the peripherals and other hardware connected to the
motherboard are in working order.
If any hardware is not working or is not detected, an error message is
displayed on the screen.
POST works BEFORE the motherboard's video card is activated and it's the FIRST
thing you will see once video is activated
* Beep Codes
* Beep codes are patterns of beeps used by the BIOS to indicate a serious error
* Pattern of beeps bay be a variable number of short beeps or a mixture of
  long and short beeps. (check motherboard manual)

Module 1: ​System Unit HardwareLesson 1.2:​ Basic PC OperationsSkills Learned From This Lesson: Basic PC Operations, What is POST, BIOS/ UEFI, BIOSComponents, BIOS Configuration, and Built-in DiagnosticsPC or Tower is the “System Unit”-System Unit = CPU, Hard drives, memory, motherboard, and other internalcomponents-Provides processing and storage-Basic usage involves inputting of information and its output-Everything connects to the system is a peripheral. (two types)-Input – mouse, keyboards, scanners, track pads, etc-Output – Monitors, Printers, speakers, projectors

Lesson 1.3​: POST – Power On Self Test-When the system unit is powered on, the CPU checks throughout themotherboards and verifies that the peripherals and other hardware connected tothe motherboard are in working order-If any hardware is not working or is not detected, an error message is displayedon the screen.-POST works BEFORE the motherboard’s video card is activated and it’s theFIRST thing you will see once video is activated-Beep Codes-Beep codes are patterns of beeps used by the BIOS to indicate a seriouserror

-Pattern of beeps bay be a variable number of short beeps or a mixture oflong and short beeps. (check motherboard manual)Lesson 1.4​: Video Name: Explaining BIOS/ UEFISkills Learned From This Lesson: What the BIOS is, Understand the roles of the BIOS,-BIOS – Basic Input/ Output System- prior to the OS starting BIOS runs, if not OSinstalled BIOS will still run-BIOS is what starts your system-A part of BIOS is POST-After checking the hardware BIOS looks for the boot loaders (hands thestart up process over to the OS)-BIOS resides on a chip on the motherboard-Traditional / Legacy BIOS been around for 25 years.-BIOS settings saved to CMOS (Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor)-Must have power to store the settings.-UEFI BIOS-Unified Extensible Firmware Interface-Based on Intel’s EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface)-Can boot from drives of 2.2TB or larger-Supports secure boot-Has a pre-boot environment-Changes are saved to flash memory, not CMOS-CMOS Battery-Maintained constant power to the CMOS in legacy BIOS systems-If battery lost power all settings were lost-BIOS has password settings for security, but removing the CMOS battery wouldclear it back to the default-In UEFI systems, the CMOS battery keeps the date and time.Lesson 1.5​ – BIOS componentsSkills Learned from this lesson:  BIOS-Changeable items in BIOS-Keeps track of hardware in your system
