=== 1.1 Given a scenario, install and configure laptop hardware and components.

.Hardware/device replacement
Safety First:
  Wear an electrostatic wrist strap.
  Remove the battery.
  Ensure that the laptop is not plugged in.
Make sure that the replacement part is compatible with the laptop.
  You can look up replacement parts from the manufacturer's website.
Locate the maintenance manual for your laptop (available online or through the
manufacturer).
  Laptops can be tricky to open.
  It is always helpful to know how components fit together.
  Many laptop contain hidden cables or screws.
Check the warranty status of the laptop. If the laptop is under warranty, you
may be able to obtain replacement part and/or service at no cost.
Make sure that have the correct tools.
  Screw drivers with different bits (some newer laptop contain small star-shaped
  screws)
  Spudger and guitar picks too remove plastic components
Each time you remove a screw, you should label it with the location from where
it was removed.
  A typical laptop will have five to ten different types of screws, and it might
be difficult to tell them apart (for example a 2.5mm screw and a 3mm screw).
  It is important that the screws go back exactly where they came from.
7. Some screws are hidden under stickers or rubber pads, especially on the bottom of the

== 3.0 Hardware 27%

=== 3.1 Explain basic cable types, features, and their purposes.

Cables: You must be able to describe different cable types and their
characteristics and uses.

Network Cables: connect devices to the network. The most common types are
Ethernet, fiber, and coaxial cable.
* Ethernet: cables use twisted pairs of copper wire. It may be shielded or
  unshielded. Each category of cable has specific physical characteristics and a
  maximum data rate. Ethernet cables have a maximum length of 100 meters.
** Cat 5: Category 5 cable supports data rate up to 100 Mbps.
** Cat 5e: Category 5e cable supports data rates up to 1 Gbps.
** Cat 6: Category 6 cable supports data rates up to 10 Gbps up to 55 meters and
   1 Gbps up to 100 meters.
** Plenum: cables is used in the plenum space of a building. Any space that
   handles air circulation in a HVAC system is plenum space, typically above a
   drop ceiling or below a raised floor. Plenum cable uses low-smoke and
   low-flame materials for fire prevention.
** Shielded twisted pair: STP Ethernet cable uses two or four pairs of copper
   wire. It uses a foil or braided shield to reduce electromagnetic
   interference. Depending on the type of cable, each twisted pair may be
   shielded or a single shield covers all twisted pairs.
** Unshielded twisted pair: UTP Ethernet cable uses two or four pairs of copper
   wire. The twist in the wires reduces electromagnetic interference.
** 568A/B:Ethernet cables are terminated with RJ-45 connectors. The pin-out
   (which wire connects to which pin) of those connectors is defined in the
   EIA/TIA 568A & 568B Standards. The difference between 568A and 568B is that
   the transmit and receive pairs are reversed. This allows for two types of
   cables, straight-through and crossover.
** Straight-through: is used to connect a device to the network via a switch or
   hub. It uses the same pin-out both ends, whether 568A or 568B. A crossover
   cable is used to connect one device directly to another, such as two
   computers, without a switch or hub between them. Crossover cables use 568B on
   the other.
Fiber: optic cable uses light pulses to transmit data through a glass or plastic
core. The cable consists of four layers. The core is surrounded by a cladding
that refracts light back into to core. The other two layers are the outer
sheath, the part you see, and a strength member or buffer to protect the fiber.
