About the Exam

The CompTIA CySA+ CS0-004 V4 certification exam will certify the successful candidate has the knowledge
and skills required to:
•
•
•
•

Understand and perform incident response and vulnerability management processes.
Detect and analyze indicators of malicious activity in support of security operations.
Use appropriate tools, methods, and frameworks to prioritize and manage vulnerabilities and respond
to incidents.
Understand reporting and communication concepts related to vulnerability management and incident
response activities.

This is the equivalent of approximately 4 years of IT experience in a SOC analyst (level 2) or a vulnerability
analyst role. These content examples are meant to clarify the test objectives and should not be construed as
a comprehensive listing of all the content of this examination.
