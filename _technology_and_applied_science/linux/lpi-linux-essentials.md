# LPI Linux Essentials

The purpose of the Linux Essentials Certificate is to define the basic knowledge
required to competently use a desktop or mobile device using a Linux Operating
System.

## Candidate Description

This is a description of a candidate that is just barely qualified to pass the
Linux Essentials exam.  This hypothetical person is called the Minimally
Qualified Candidate (MQC).  Standards on the Linux Essentials exam should be set
so that this person (and anyone more able) would pass but anyone less able would
not pass.

The Linux Essentials MQC should have rudimentary skills or knowledge in the
following topics:

- Free and Open Source Software, the various communities and licenses
- Processes, programs and the components of an operating system
- Computer hardware
- System security, users/groups and file permissions for public and private
directories
- Make the system accessible and able to connect to other computers on a Local
Area Network (LAN)
- Open Source Applications in the workplace as they relate to closed source
equivalents
- File system browsers on a Linux Desktop
- Where to go for help
- Work on the command line and with files
- Make and restore simple backups and archives
- Use a basic command line editor
- File compression
- Create and run simple shell scripts
