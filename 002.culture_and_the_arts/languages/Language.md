# Language

Language: the method of communication, either spoken or written, consisting of the use of words in a structured and conventional way.
  
  Core Components: Vocabulary and Grammar
      Language (vocabulary + grammar) Skills:
          Input (Reading, Listening) Output (Writing, Speaking)
  
  Your ability with the language comes from two factors:
      
      Understanding: How much vocabulary and grammar you "know" and how accurately you know it. This goes from passive weak understanding to strong understanding of the correct usage of a word/article/preposition in all contexts. This is just an aspect of the two core components. There are three levels of understanding. The first is simply knowledge that a word or form exists. The second is passive understanding, meaning you effortlessly see and understand it when read or heard. The final level is active understanding, when you can use a form or word actively while also being confident that it is correct.
      
      Fluency: How fast you are at producing or understanding (1) correctly. Fluency is really a type of fast recall combined with your raw ability with certain skills. Speaking and listening are the most important as they require fast processing in order to comprehend or produce the language.
      
  Grammar: Core verb/noun conjugation/declension (how they change). The general structure and logic of the language.

  Vocabulary: 100-300 basic words. This include verbs, nouns, and adjectives as the core, as well as articles (such as prepositions and articles).

  You will (should) also learn the basics for each of the four skills.

  Reading & writing: The script if it is different to English - you will need to learn that soon. Orthography (how the letters correspond to sounds) is also important.
  
  Listening & speaking: The sounds of the language, including pronunciation. If the language has sounds that might sound the same to an English speaker but are actually different and affect meaning these should be carefully covered. If your language has tones it is essential. These are considered harder than the other two skills, as using them successfully requires your brain to be able to access concepts and vocabulary very quickly.
  
  
  Types of activities

  The aspects you try to improve are either knowledge-based or skill-based. These are:
  
      Learn new grammar/vocabulary
  
      Improve your understanding of known grammar/vocabulary
  
      Getting used to and encountering forms/words you have already seen before, refining your knowledge (listening or reading)
  
      Practising producing forms/words you know, fluency practice (speed of writing or speaking)
  
      Listening skills - perceiving sounds, understanding connected speech
  
      Writing skills - spelling
  
      Speaking skills - pronunciation, speaking fluidly
  
      Reading skills - recognising characters (for languages that use logographic writing systems like Chinese), using context clues to help learn, skim reading for key ideas.


  
  
  
  Linguistics the scientific study of language and its structure, including the study of grammar, syntax, and phonetics.
  
      Morphology the study the forms of words, in particular inflected forms.
          Morpheme is the smallest unit in a language, is not identical to a word, principal difference: a morpheme may or may not stand alone, whereas a word, by definition, is freestanding
              Free morpheme can function independently as words and fan appear within lexemes
              Bound morpheme appear only as parts, always in conjunction with a root and sometimes with other bound morphemes
                  Cranberry morphemes are bound morphemes that are not affixed
          Root word is a morpheme that stand by itself and has a meaning of its own
              is free morpheme 
              Needs to study most common then continue from there
          Affix: an addition to root word in order to modify its meaning, create a new word or word form
              is a bound morpheme
              Prefix (prefixation) add a morpheme at the beginning of a root word
                  Needs to study most common then continue from there
              Suffix (suffixation) add a morpheme at the end of a root word
                  Needs to study most common then continue from there
              Infix (infixation) add a morpheme at the middle of a root word
              Circumfix
              Interfix
              Duplifix
              Transfix
              Simulfix
              Suprafix
              Disfix
      Phonetics
      Phonology
      Syntax
          Noun
          Verb
          Adjective
          Adverb
          Pronoun
          Preposition
          Conjunction
          Article
          Determiner
      Semantics
      Pramatics
      Parts of Speech
          noun(n.) - a name word
          verb(v.) - an action
          adjective(adj.) - a describing
              adverb(adv.)
          preposition(prep.)
          pronoun(pro.) - a word used in place of a noun
          conjunction(conj.) - a joining word 

Types of fluency

There are four commonly discussed types of fluency: reading fluency, oral fluency, oral-reading fluency, and written or compositional fluency. These types of fluency are interrelated, but do not necessarily develop in tandem or linearly. One may develop fluency in certain type(s) and be less fluent or nonfluent in others.[5]

In the sense of proficiency, "fluency" encompasses a number of related but separable skills:

Reading fluency refers to the link between the recognition of words while reading and reading comprehension,[4][11] which manifests itself in the speed and accuracy that one is able to read text.[4] Research on reading fluency aligns concepts of accuracy, automaticity, and prosody.[11] To achieve reading fluency, readers must have knowledge of the content of the language as well as the vocabulary being used. Interventions designed to help children learn to read fluently generally include some form of repeated reading, but this process may differ for children with learning disabilities, who may struggle with reading fluency.[5]
Oral fluency or speaking fluency is a measurement both of production and reception of speech, as a fluent speaker must be able to understand and respond to others in conversation. Spoken language is typically characterized by seemingly non-fluent qualities (e.g., fragmentation, pauses, false starts, hesitation, repetition) because of ‘task stress.’ How orally fluent one is can therefore be understood in terms of perception, and whether these qualities of speech can be perceived as expected and natural (i.e., fluent) or unusual and problematic (i.e., non-fluent).[4]
Oral reading fluency is sometimes distinguished from oral fluency. Oral reading fluency refers to the ability to read words accurately and quickly while using good vocal expression and phrasing.[11] Oral reading fluency is often linked to Schreiber’s Theory of Prosody, which places importance on the tone, rhythm, and expressiveness of speech.[12]
Written or compositional fluency can be measured in a variety of ways. Researchers have measured by length of the composition (especially under timed conditions), words produced per minute, sentence length, or words per clause. Ratio measures (e.g., words per clause, words per sentence, and words per error-free sentence) have historically been most valid and reliable.[5]

The components of speech production include:
- phonation (producing sound)
- resonance
- flunecy
- intonation
- pitch variance;
- voice (including aeromechanical components of respiration)

The components of language include:
- Phonology (manipulating sound according to the rules of a language);
- Morphology (understanding components of words and how they can modify meaning);
- Syntax (constructing sentence according to the grammatical rules of a target
language);
- Semantics (interpreting signs or symbols of communication such as words or
signs to construct meaning);
- Pragmatics (social aspect of communication)
